00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:49.402
You're a smart insurance man,
aren't you, Mr. Neff?

2
00:00:49.443 --> 00:00:52.029
Well, <i>I've been</i><b> at it 11 years</b>
Doing pretty well?

3
00:00:52.071 --> 00:00:53.448
It's a living.

4
00:00:54.198 --> 00:00:57.744
You handle just automobile
insurance, or all kinds?

5
00:00:57.827 --> 00:00:59.489
All kinds. Fire,
earthquake, theft,

6
00:00:59.514 --> 00:01:01.247
public liability,
group insurance...

7
00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:03.750
industrial stuff and so on,
right down the line.

8
00:01:03.917 --> 00:01:05.168
Accident insurance?

9
00:01:05.251 --> 00:01:07.462
Accident insurance?
Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.

10
00:01:09.422 --> 00:01:12.592
Wish you'd tell me what's
engraved on that anklet.

11
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:15.554
Just my name. As, for instance?

12
00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:18.890
Phyllis. Phyllis?

13
00:01:19.558 --> 00:01:22.352
I think I like that.
But you're not sure?

14
00:01:22.436 --> 00:01:25.564
I'd have to drive it around
the block a couple of times.

15
00:01:25.647 --> 00:01:28.400
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop
by tomorrow evening around 8:30?

16
00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:30.319
He'll be in then. Who?

17
00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:33.614
My husband. You were anxious
to talk to him, weren't you?

18
00:01:33.697 --> 00:01:36.617
Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of
getting over the idea...

19
00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.035
if you know what I mean.

20
00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.539
There's a speed limit in this
state, Mr. Neff. 45 miles an hour.

21
00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:44.875
How fast was I going, officer?
I'd say around 90.

22
00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:47.607
Suppose you get down off your
motorcycle and give me a ticket.

23
00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:49.881
Suppose I let you off
with a warning this time.

24
00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:51.674
Suppose it doesn't take.

25
00:01:51.758 --> 00:01:54.135
Suppose I have to whack you
over the knuckles.

26
00:01:54.177 --> 00:01:57.096
Suppose I bust out crying and
put my head on your shoulder.

27
00:01:57.138 --> 00:02:00.266
Suppose you try putting it
on my husband's shoulder.

28
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.851
That tears it.

29
00:02:06.147 --> 00:02:09.526
8:30 tomorrow evening then.
That's what I suggested.

30
00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.279
Will you be here, too?
I guess so, I usually am.

31
00:02:12.362 --> 00:02:14.656
Same chair, same perfume,
same anklet?

32
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.783
I wonder if I know
what you mean.

33
00:02:17.784 --> 00:02:19.661
I wonder if you wonder.

34
00:02:23.332 --> 00:02:25.751
<i>It was a hot afternoon</i>
and I can still remember...</i><//i>

35
00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:28.754
<i>the smell of honeysuckle</i>
all along that street.</i><//i>
