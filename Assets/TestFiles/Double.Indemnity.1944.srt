1
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,585
Why, hello there, Mr. Neff.

2
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:46,111
Working pretty late,
aren't you, Mr.

3
00:02:46,136 --> 00:02:48,019
Neff? Late enough. Let's ride.

4
00:02:51,355 --> 00:02:54,275
You look kind of all
in, at that. I'm fine.

5
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:57,820
How is the insurance
business, Mr. Neff? Okay.

6
00:02:58,696 --> 00:03:00,490
They wouldn't ever sell me any.

7
00:03:00,573 --> 00:03:02,333
They said I have something
loose in my heart.

8
00:03:03,576 --> 00:03:05,870
I say it's rheumatism. Yeah?

9
00:03:06,746 --> 00:03:07,998
Twelve.

10
00:05:03,742 --> 00:05:05,410
Office memorandum.

11
00:05:06,536 --> 00:05:09,414
Walter Neff to Barton Keyes,
Claims Manager.

12
00:05:10,707 --> 00:05:12,918
Los Angeles, July 16, 1938.

13
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:16,380
Dear Keyes...

14
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:20,968
I suppose you'll call this
a confession when you hear it.

15
00:05:21,051 --> 00:05:23,387
Well, I don't like
the word confession.

16
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:25,597
I just want to set you right
about something you couldn't see...

17
00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:27,349
because it was smack up
against your nose.

18
00:05:28,559 --> 00:05:30,644
You think you're such a hot
potato as a Claims Manager...

19
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:32,897
such a wolf on a phony claim.

20
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:37,902
Maybe you are, but let's take a
look at that Dietrichson claim.

21
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,322
Accident and double indemnity.

22
00:05:42,198 --> 00:05:45,368
You were pretty good in there
for a while, Keyes.

23
00:05:45,618 --> 00:05:48,246
You said it wasn't
an accident. Check.

24
00:05:48,663 --> 00:05:51,082
You said it wasn't suicide.
Check.

25
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:55,086
You said it was murder. Check.

26
00:05:57,255 --> 00:05:59,758
You thought you had it cold,
didn't you?

27
00:05:59,841 --> 00:06:03,053
All wrapped up in tissue paper,
with pink ribbons around it.

28
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:04,638
It was perfect.

29
00:06:05,263 --> 00:06:08,225
Except it wasn't, because
you made one mistake...

30
00:06:08,308 --> 00:06:10,227
just one little mistake.

31
00:06:11,436 --> 00:06:15,274
When it came to picking the
killer, you picked the wrong guy.

32
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:18,902
You want to know who
killed Dietrichson?

33
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,614
Hold tight to that
cheap cigar of yours, Keyes.

34
00:06:24,074 --> 00:06:25,618
I killed Dietrichson.

35
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:28,579
Me, Walter Neff,
insurance salesman.

36
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:31,791
35 years old, unmarried,
no visible scars...

37
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:36,045
until a while ago, that is.

38
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:39,173
Yes, I killed him.

39
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:42,927
I killed him for money...

40
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:44,595
and for a woman.

41
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:50,560
And I didn't get the money
and I didn't get the woman.

42
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,397
Pretty, isn't it?

43
00:07:08,245 --> 00:07:10,122
It all began last May.

44
00:07:11,373 --> 00:07:12,582
Around the end of May, it was.

45
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:16,945
<i>I'd been out to
Glendale to deliver</i>

46
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,881
<i>a policy on some dairy trucks.</i>

47
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:20,811
<i>On the way back I
remembered this auto</i>

48
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:22,468
<i>renewal near Los
Feliz Boulevard.</i>

49
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:24,470
<i>So I drove over there.</i>

50
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,472
<i>It was one of those
California Spanish houses...</i>

51
00:07:26,555 --> 00:07:29,475
<i>everyone was nuts about
10 or 15 years ago.</i>

52
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,978
<i>This one must've cost somebody
about $30,000.</i>

53
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:35,523
<i>That is, if he ever
finished paying for it.</i>

54
00:07:38,401 --> 00:07:39,861
Is Mr. Dietrichson in?

55
00:07:39,944 --> 00:07:42,488
Who wants to see him? My
name is Neff. Walter Neff.

56
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,399
If you're selling something...
Look, it's Mr.

57
00:07:44,424 --> 00:07:45,783
Dietrichson I want to talk to...

58
00:07:45,867 --> 00:07:46,993
and it's not
magazine subscriptions.

59
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:49,516
Listen, Mr. Dietrichson is not
in. How soon do you expect him?

60
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:51,748
He'll be home when he gets
here, if that's any help to you.

61
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:53,541
What is it, Nettie? Who is it?

62
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,418
It's for Mr. Dietrichson.

63
00:07:55,502 --> 00:07:57,587
I'm Mrs. Dietrichson.
What is it?

64
00:07:58,254 --> 00:07:59,714
How do you do, Mrs. Dietrichson?

65
00:07:59,798 --> 00:08:01,716
I'm Walter Neff,
Pacific All Risk.

66
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,970
Pacific all what? The Pacific
All Risk Insurance Company.

67
00:08:05,053 --> 00:08:07,013
It's about some renewals
on the automobiles.

68
00:08:07,097 --> 00:08:08,307
I've been trying to contact your

69
00:08:08,332 --> 00:08:09,683
husband for the
past two weeks...

70
00:08:09,725 --> 00:08:12,895
but he's never in his office.
Is there anything I can do?

71
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:14,479
The insurance ran out
on the 15th.

72
00:08:14,563 --> 00:08:16,690
I'd hate to think of your
having a smashed fender...

73
00:08:16,732 --> 00:08:18,358
or something while you're not...

74
00:08:18,442 --> 00:08:19,693
fully covered.

75
00:08:20,903 --> 00:08:23,197
Perhaps I know
what you mean, Mr. Neff.

76
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:27,076
I've just been taking a sunbath.
No pigeons around, I hope.

77
00:08:28,077 --> 00:08:29,698
About those policies, Mrs.
Dietrichson,

78
00:08:29,723 --> 00:08:31,205
I hate to take up
your time, but...

79
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:32,623
That's all right.

80
00:08:32,707 --> 00:08:35,209
If you'll wait till I put
something on, I'll be right down.

81
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:38,171
Nettie, show Mr. Neff
into the living room.

82
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,175
Where would the living room be?

83
00:08:42,258 --> 00:08:44,677
In there, but they keep
the liquor locked up.

84
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:47,722
It's all right.
I always carry my own keys.

85
00:08:55,105 --> 00:08:56,773
<i>The living
room was still stuffy...</i>

86
00:08:56,856 --> 00:08:58,525
<i>from last night's cigars.</i>

87
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:00,569
<i>The windows were closed...</i>

88
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,654
<i>and the sunshine coming in
through the venetian blinds...</i>

89
00:09:02,737 --> 00:09:04,948
<i>showed up the dust in the air.</i>

90
00:09:06,283 --> 00:09:08,741
<i>On the piano, in a couple
of fancy frames, were Mr.</i>

91
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:09,912
<i>Dietrichson and Lola...</i>

92
00:09:09,995 --> 00:09:12,247
<i>his daughter by his first wife.</i>

93
00:09:13,499 --> 00:09:15,751
<i>They had a bowl of those
little red goldfish...</i>

94
00:09:15,793 --> 00:09:18,212
<i>on the table behind
the big davenport.</i>

95
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,630
<i>But to tell you
the truth, Keyes...</i>

96
00:09:19,713 --> 00:09:22,758
<i>I wasn't a whole lot interested
in goldfish right then.</i>

97
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,576
<i>Or in auto renewals, or in Mr.</i>

98
00:09:24,601 --> 00:09:26,762
<i>Dietrichson and his
daughter Lola.</i>

99
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:28,908
<i>I was thinking about
that dame upstairs,</i>

100
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:30,766
<i>and the way she had
looked at me...</i>

101
00:09:30,808 --> 00:09:33,519
<i>and I wanted
to see her again, close...</i>

102
00:09:33,603 --> 00:09:36,314
<i>without that silly staircase
between us.</i>

103
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:44,030
I wasn't long, was I?
Not at all, Mrs. Dietrichson.

104
00:09:44,113 --> 00:09:47,617
Hope I've got my face on straight.
It's perfect, for my money.

105
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:49,119
Neff is the name, isn't it?
Yeah.

106
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,520
With two "F's," like in
Philadelphia, if you know the story.

107
00:09:51,538 --> 00:09:54,124
<i>What story?
The Philadelphia Story.</i>

108
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:56,334
Suppose we sit down and you
tell me about the insurance.

109
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:58,920
My husband never
tells me anything.

110
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:02,340
Well, it's on your two cars,
the LaSalle and the Plymouth.

111
00:10:03,842 --> 00:10:05,538
We've been handling
this insurance for Mr.

112
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,803
Dietrichson for three years...

113
00:10:06,887 --> 00:10:09,431
and we'd hate to see
the policies lapse.

114
00:10:09,848 --> 00:10:13,644
That's a honey of an anklet
you're wearing, Mrs. Dietrichson.

115
00:10:13,852 --> 00:10:16,355
As I was saying, we'd hate
to see the policies lapse.

116
00:10:16,438 --> 00:10:17,748
Of course, we give them 30 days.

117
00:10:17,773 --> 00:10:19,233
That's all we're
allowed to give.

118
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:21,836
I guess he's been too busy down
at Long Beach in the oil fields.

119
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:24,071
Couldn't I catch him at home
some evening for a few minutes?

120
00:10:24,155 --> 00:10:26,155
I suppose so. But he's
never home much before 8:00.

121
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:27,491
That's fine with me.

122
00:10:27,533 --> 00:10:29,577
You're not connected with
the Automobile Club, are you?

123
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,038
No, the All Risk,
Mrs. Dietrichson. Why?

124
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:35,082
Somebody from the Automobile
Club has been trying to get him.

125
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:38,002
Do they have a better rate?
If your husband's a member.

126
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:39,128
No, he isn't.

127
00:10:39,212 --> 00:10:40,829
Well, then he'd have
to join the club and

128
00:10:40,854 --> 00:10:42,340
pay the membership
fee to start with.

129
00:10:42,423 --> 00:10:45,134
I never knock the other fellow's
merchandise, Mrs. Dietrichson.

130
00:10:45,218 --> 00:10:47,204
The Automobile Club's fine.
I can

131
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,180
do just as well for you, though.

132
00:10:49,222 --> 00:10:51,433
I have a very attractive
policy here.

133
00:10:51,516 --> 00:10:52,865
It wouldn't take
me two minutes to

134
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,185
put it in front of your husband.

135
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:55,514
For instance, we're
writing a new

136
00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:56,819
kind of 50% retention feature...

137
00:10:56,897 --> 00:10:58,899
in the collision coverage.

138
00:10:59,441 --> 00:11:01,902
You're a smart insurance man,
aren't you, Mr. Neff?

139
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:04,529
Well, I've been at it 11
years. Doing pretty well?

140
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:05,948
It's a living.

141
00:11:06,698 --> 00:11:10,244
You handle just automobile
insurance, or all kinds?

142
00:11:10,327 --> 00:11:11,989
All kinds. Fire,
earthquake, theft,

143
00:11:12,014 --> 00:11:13,747
public liability,
group insurance...

144
00:11:13,831 --> 00:11:16,250
industrial stuff and so on,
right down the line.

145
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:17,668
Accident insurance?

146
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:19,962
Accident insurance?
Sure, Mrs. Dietrichson.

147
00:11:21,922 --> 00:11:25,092
Wish you'd tell me what's
engraved on that anklet.

148
00:11:25,551 --> 00:11:28,054
Just my name. As, for instance?

149
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,390
Phyllis. Phyllis?

150
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:34,852
I think I like that.
But you're not sure?

151
00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:38,064
I'd have to drive it around
the block a couple of times.

152
00:11:38,147 --> 00:11:40,900
Mr. Neff, why don't you drop
by tomorrow evening around 8:30?

153
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:42,819
He'll be in then. Who?

154
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:46,114
My husband. You were anxious
to talk to him, weren't you?

155
00:11:46,197 --> 00:11:49,117
Yeah, I was, but I'm sort of
getting over the idea...

156
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,535
if you know what I mean.

157
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:54,039
There's a speed limit in this
state, Mr. Neff. 45 miles an hour.

158
00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:57,375
How fast was I going, officer?
I'd say around 90.

159
00:11:57,667 --> 00:12:00,107
Suppose you get down off your
motorcycle and give me a ticket.

160
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:02,381
Suppose I let you off
with a warning this time.

161
00:12:02,464 --> 00:12:04,174
Suppose it doesn't take.

162
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:06,635
Suppose I have to whack you
over the knuckles.

163
00:12:06,677 --> 00:12:09,596
Suppose I bust out crying and
put my head on your shoulder.

164
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:12,766
Suppose you try putting it
on my husband's shoulder.

165
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:14,351
That tears it.

166
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:22,026
8:30 tomorrow evening then.
That's what I suggested.

167
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:24,779
Will you be here, too?
I guess so, I usually am.

168
00:12:24,862 --> 00:12:27,156
Same chair, same perfume,
same anklet?

169
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,283
I wonder if I know
what you mean.

170
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:32,161
I wonder if you wonder.

171
00:12:35,832 --> 00:12:38,251
<i>It was a hot afternoon
and I can still remember...</i>

172
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:41,254
<i>the smell of honeysuckle
all along that street.</i>

173
00:12:41,337 --> 00:12:43,563
<i>How could I have known
that murder can</i>

174
00:12:43,588 --> 00:12:45,550
<i>sometimes smell
like honeysuckle?</i>

175
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:46,801
<i>Maybe you would
have known, Keyes...</i>

176
00:12:46,885 --> 00:12:50,513
<i>the minute she mentioned
accident insurance, but I didn't.</i>

177
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:52,474
<i>I felt like a million.</i>

178
00:12:53,183 --> 00:12:56,436
<i>I went back to the office
to see if I had any mail.</i>

179
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:58,159
<i>It was the day you
had that truck</i>

180
00:12:58,184 --> 00:12:59,815
<i>driver from Inglewood
on the carpet.</i>

181
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:01,191
<i>Remember, Keyes?</i>

182
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,652
Mr. Neff, Mr. Keyes
wants to see you.

183
00:13:03,694 --> 00:13:05,612
He's been yelling for you
all afternoon.

184
00:13:05,696 --> 00:13:07,696
Is he sore, or just frothing
at the mouth a little?

185
00:13:07,698 --> 00:13:09,742
Park this for me,
will you, sweetheart?

186
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:16,248
Hello, Walter. Hi, George.

187
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:19,502
Come on. Come on, Garlopis.

188
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:21,503
You're not kidding anybody
with that line of bull.

189
00:13:21,504 --> 00:13:23,547
You're in a jam and
you know it. Says you.

190
00:13:23,631 --> 00:13:25,841
All I want is my money. Says you.

191
00:13:25,925 --> 00:13:28,553
All you're gonna get
is the cops. Hello, Walter.

192
00:13:28,719 --> 00:13:31,806
This is Sam Garlopis from
Inglewood. Sure, I know Mr. Garlopis.

193
00:13:31,889 --> 00:13:34,809
Wrote a policy on his truck.
How are you, Mr. Garlopis?

194
00:13:34,892 --> 00:13:39,147
I ain't so good. My truck burned
down. Yeah. Now look, Garlopis.

195
00:13:39,898 --> 00:13:42,400
Every month hundreds of claims
come to this desk.

196
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:44,736
Some of them are phonies,
and I know which ones.

197
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:47,822
How do I know? Because
my little man tells me.

198
00:13:49,074 --> 00:13:51,910
What little man?
The little man in here.

199
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,699
Every time one of
these phonies comes

200
00:13:53,724 --> 00:13:55,205
along, it ties knots
in my stomach.

201
00:13:55,288 --> 00:13:56,748
I can't eat.

202
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,479
Yours is one of them, Garlopis.
That's

203
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,043
how I knew your
claim was crooked.

204
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:01,628
So what did I do?

205
00:14:01,712 --> 00:14:04,298
I sent a tow car over to your
garage this afternoon...

206
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:06,258
and they jacked up that
burned-out truck of yours.

207
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,843
And what did they find?

208
00:14:07,926 --> 00:14:11,221
They found what was left
of a neat pile of shavings.

209
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,848
What shavings?

210
00:14:12,932 --> 00:14:16,477
The ones you soaked with
kerosene and dropped a match on.

211
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,233
Look, Mister, I'm just a poor
guy. Maybe I made a mistake.

212
00:14:22,525 --> 00:14:24,610
That's one way of putting it.

213
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:26,904
I ain't feeling so good,
Mr. Keyes.

214
00:14:26,988 --> 00:14:29,240
Here. Just a minute. Sign
this and you'll feel fine.

215
00:14:29,282 --> 00:14:32,160
Sign what? It's a waiver
on your claim. Right here.

216
00:14:33,411 --> 00:14:34,787
Here? Here.

217
00:14:38,374 --> 00:14:41,544
Now you're an honest man
again. Goodbye, Garlopis.

218
00:14:41,628 --> 00:14:43,546
But I ain't got no more truck.

219
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:46,007
$2,600 is lot of dough
where I live.

220
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:47,411
What's the matter,
Garlopis, don't

221
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:48,618
you know how to open the door?

222
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:51,930
Just put your hand on the
knob, turn it to the left.

223
00:14:52,806 --> 00:14:54,808
Now pull it toward you.

224
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,563
That's the boy.
Thank you, Mr. Keyes.

225
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:05,194
What kind of an outfit
is this, anyway?

226
00:15:05,277 --> 00:15:06,685
Are we an insurance
company, or just

227
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,990
a bunch of dimwitted amateurs...

228
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:09,281
to write a policy
on a mug like that?

229
00:15:09,365 --> 00:15:10,991
Now, wait a minute, Keyes.
I don't rate this beef.

230
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:12,618
I clipped a note to that
Garlopis application...

231
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:13,702
to have him
thoroughly investigated...

232
00:15:13,786 --> 00:15:15,496
before we accepted the risk.
I know you did, Walter.

233
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:17,133
I'm not beefing at you.
It's the company.

234
00:15:17,158 --> 00:15:18,278
It's the way they do things.

235
00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:19,492
The way they don't do things!

236
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,860
The way they'll
write anything just

237
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,211
to get it down on
the sales sheet.

238
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:23,592
And I'm the guy that
has to sit here

239
00:15:23,617 --> 00:15:24,797
up to my neck in phony claims...

240
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,319
so they won't throw
more money out the

241
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:27,800
window than they
take in at the door.

242
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:29,677
Okay, turn the record over,
let's hear the other side.

243
00:15:29,761 --> 00:15:31,444
Well, I get darn sick
of trying to pick up

244
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:33,097
after a gang of
fast-talking salesmen...

245
00:15:33,181 --> 00:15:34,849
dumb enough to sell
life insurance to a guy...

246
00:15:34,933 --> 00:15:36,810
who sleeps in the same bed
with four rattlesnakes.

247
00:15:36,851 --> 00:15:38,102
Walter, I've had
26 years of this

248
00:15:38,127 --> 00:15:39,487
and let me tell
you, I'm getting...

249
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,523
Yeah, and you've loved
every minute of it, Keyes.

250
00:15:41,564 --> 00:15:43,583
You love it, only you
worry about it too

251
00:15:43,608 --> 00:15:45,402
darn much, you and
your little man.

252
00:15:45,485 --> 00:15:47,845
You're so darn conscientious,
you're driving yourself crazy.

253
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,288
You wouldn't even say
today is Tuesday

254
00:15:49,313 --> 00:15:50,633
unless you looked
at the calendar.

255
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:51,912
Then you'd check
to see if it was

256
00:15:51,937 --> 00:15:53,337
this year's or last
year's calendar.

257
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:54,745
Then you'd find out
who printed the calendar...

258
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,276
<i>and find out if their
calendar checked</i>

259
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:57,623
<i>with the World
Almanac's calendar.</i>

260
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,874
Now, that's enough
from you, Walter.

261
00:15:58,957 --> 00:16:02,169
Now, get out of here
before I throw my desk at you.

262
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,216
I love you, too.

263
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,183
<i>I really did,
too, you old crab...</i>

264
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,562
<i>always yelling your head off,
always sore at everybody.</i>

265
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,581
<i>But you never
fooled me with your</i>

266
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,441
<i>song and dance.
Not for a second.</i>

267
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,767
<i>I kind of always
knew that behind</i>

268
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:26,032
<i>the cigar ashes on your vest...</i>

269
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,446
<i>you had a heart
as big as a house.</i>

270
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,398
<i>Back in my office
there was a phone</i>

271
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,703
<i>message from Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

272
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:33,493
<i>about the renewals.</i>

273
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:36,746
<i>She didn't want me to come
tomorrow evening.</i>

274
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:40,542
<i>She wanted me to come Thursday
afternoon at 3:30 instead.</i>

275
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:44,337
<i>I had a lot of stuff lined up
for that Thursday afternoon...</i>

276
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,381
<i>including a trip
down to Santa Monica...</i>

277
00:16:46,423 --> 00:16:50,218
<i>to see a couple of live prospects
about some group insurance.</i>

278
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,388
<i>But I kept thinking
about Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

279
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,974
<i>and the way that anklet
of hers cut into her leg.</i>

280
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,068
Hello, Mr. Neff.
Aren't you coming in?

281
00:17:06,986 --> 00:17:08,737
I'm considering it.

282
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,908
I hope you didn't mind
my changing the appointment.

283
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:15,953
Last night wasn't so
convenient. That's all right.

284
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:18,122
I was working on
my stamp collection anyway.

285
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:20,405
I was just fixing some iced
tea. Would you like a glass?

286
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,710
Yeah, unless you've got a bottle
of beer that's not working.

287
00:17:22,794 --> 00:17:25,380
There may be some. I never
know what's in the icebox.

288
00:17:25,463 --> 00:17:26,631
Nettie.

289
00:17:30,677 --> 00:17:34,264
About those renewals, Mr. Neff.
I talked to my husband about it.

290
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:37,058
You did? Yes. He'll
renew with you, he told me so.

291
00:17:37,142 --> 00:17:39,686
As a matter of fact, I thought
he'd be here this afternoon.

292
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:40,937
But he's not? No.

293
00:17:42,105 --> 00:17:43,690
That's terrible.

294
00:17:44,316 --> 00:17:46,318
Nettie!

295
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:49,696
I forgot,
today's the maid's day off.

296
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:53,659
Never mind the beer.
Iced tea will be fine.

297
00:17:53,742 --> 00:17:56,036
Lemon? Sugar? Fix it your way.

298
00:17:57,746 --> 00:17:59,630
As long as it's the
maid's day off, maybe

299
00:17:59,655 --> 00:18:01,291
there's something
I can do for you.

300
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:04,545
Like running the vacuum cleaner. Fresh.

301
00:18:05,004 --> 00:18:07,423
I used to peddle
vacuum cleaners.

302
00:18:07,506 --> 00:18:09,425
Not much money, but you
learn a lot about life.

303
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:13,179
I didn't think you'd learned
it from a correspondence course.

304
00:18:14,722 --> 00:18:16,974
Where'd you pick up
this tea drinking?

305
00:18:17,016 --> 00:18:19,227
You're not English, are you?
No. Californian.

306
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,354
Born right here in Los Angeles.

307
00:18:21,437 --> 00:18:24,524
They say all native
Californians come from Iowa.

308
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,152
Mr. Neff, I... Make it Walter?

309
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:30,071
Walter. That's right.

310
00:18:30,488 --> 00:18:32,748
Tell me, Walter,
on this insurance,

311
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:34,868
how much commission do you make?

312
00:18:35,035 --> 00:18:36,536
Twenty percent. Why?

313
00:18:36,578 --> 00:18:39,205
I thought perhaps I could throw
a little more business your way.

314
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:41,875
I can always use it. I was
thinking about my husband.

315
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:44,377
I worry a lot about him
down in those oil fields.

316
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:46,713
It's very dangerous.
Not for an executive, is it?

317
00:18:46,797 --> 00:18:48,215
He doesn't just sit
behind a desk.

318
00:18:48,256 --> 00:18:50,550
He's right down there
with those drilling crews.

319
00:18:50,634 --> 00:18:51,843
It's got me worried sick.

320
00:18:51,927 --> 00:18:54,263
You mean, some dark night a
crown block might fall on him?

321
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:56,807
Please don't talk like that.
But that's the idea.

322
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,852
The other day a casing line
snapped and caught the foreman.

323
00:18:59,935 --> 00:19:02,730
He's in the hospital with
a broken back. That's bad.

324
00:19:02,813 --> 00:19:05,316
It's got me jittery
just thinking about it.

325
00:19:05,399 --> 00:19:07,610
Suppose something like that
happened to my husband.

326
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:09,362
It could. Well...

327
00:19:10,738 --> 00:19:14,033
don't you think he ought to
have accident insurance?

328
00:19:15,076 --> 00:19:17,411
What kind of insurance
could he have?

329
00:19:17,495 --> 00:19:19,705
Enough to cover doctors
and hospital bills.

330
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:21,874
Say $125 a week cash benefit.

331
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,335
And he'd rate around
$50,000 capital sum.

332
00:19:24,419 --> 00:19:27,672
Capital sum? What's that?
In case he gets killed.

333
00:19:28,464 --> 00:19:30,884
Maybe I shouldn't
have said that.

334
00:19:30,925 --> 00:19:33,303
I suppose you have to think
of everything in your business.

335
00:19:33,386 --> 00:19:34,786
Well, your husband
would understand.

336
00:19:34,846 --> 00:19:36,156
I'm sure I could sell him on the

337
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:37,641
idea of some
accident protection.

338
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:39,267
Why don't I talk
to him about it?

339
00:19:39,351 --> 00:19:41,520
You could try,
but he's pretty tough-going.

340
00:19:41,603 --> 00:19:43,688
They're all tough at first.

341
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:45,732
He has a lot on his mind.

342
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:47,526
He doesn't seem to want
to listen to anything...

343
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:50,445
except maybe
a baseball game on the radio.

344
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:52,658
Sometimes we sit
here all evening

345
00:19:52,683 --> 00:19:54,700
and never say a
word to each other.

346
00:19:54,783 --> 00:19:58,412
Sounds pretty dull.
So, I just sit and knit.

347
00:19:59,788 --> 00:20:01,123
Is that what you
married him for?

348
00:20:01,207 --> 00:20:04,376
Maybe I like the way
his thumbs hold up the wool.

349
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:07,088
Anytime his thumbs get tired...

350
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:09,548
Only, with me around,
you wouldn't have to knit.

351
00:20:09,632 --> 00:20:11,717
Wouldn't I? You bet
your life, you wouldn't.

352
00:20:14,804 --> 00:20:18,224
Wonder if a little rum
would get this up on its feet.

353
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:22,812
I want to ask you
something, Walter.

354
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:26,858
Could I get an
accident policy for

355
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:28,651
him without bothering
him at all?

356
00:20:28,735 --> 00:20:29,778
How's that, again?

357
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:31,276
It would make it
easier for you, too.

358
00:20:31,301 --> 00:20:32,822
You wouldn't even
have to talk to him.

359
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,407
I have a little
allowance of my own.

360
00:20:34,491 --> 00:20:37,661
I could pay for it and he
needn't know anything about it.

361
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:41,289
Why shouldn't he know?

362
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,792
Because he doesn't want
accident insurance.

363
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:46,486
He's superstitious about it.
A lot of people are.

364
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,796
That's funny, isn't it?

365
00:20:47,838 --> 00:20:49,868
If there was a way
to get it like

366
00:20:49,893 --> 00:20:52,009
that, all the worry
would be over.

367
00:20:52,968 --> 00:20:56,055
See what I mean, Walter?
Sure. I got good eyesight.

368
00:20:56,138 --> 00:20:58,849
You mean you want him to have
the policy without him knowing it.

369
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:00,352
And that means without
the insurance

370
00:21:00,377 --> 00:21:01,977
company knowing that
he doesn't know it.

371
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:04,814
That's the setup, isn't it? Is
there anything wrong with it?

372
00:21:04,897 --> 00:21:06,232
No, I think it's lovely.

373
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:07,590
Then, if some dark,
wet night, that

374
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:08,815
crown block did fall on him...

375
00:21:08,818 --> 00:21:09,860
What crown block?

376
00:21:09,944 --> 00:21:11,504
Only sometimes it can't
quite make it on

377
00:21:11,526 --> 00:21:13,030
its own, it has to
have a little help.

378
00:21:13,114 --> 00:21:14,449
I don't know what
you're talking about.

379
00:21:14,532 --> 00:21:15,950
Of course, it doesn't have
to be a crown block.

380
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:17,571
It can be a car backing
over him, or he

381
00:21:17,596 --> 00:21:19,120
could fall out of the
upstairs window.

382
00:21:19,203 --> 00:21:21,323
Any little thing like that,
just so it's a morgue job.

383
00:21:21,372 --> 00:21:23,583
Are you crazy? Not that crazy.

384
00:21:25,668 --> 00:21:27,428
Goodbye, Mrs. Dietrichson.
What's the matter?

385
00:21:29,714 --> 00:21:32,342
Look, baby,
you can't get away with it.

386
00:21:34,219 --> 00:21:35,846
You want to knock him off,
don't you?

387
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:37,389
That's a horrible thing to say.

388
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,723
What'd you think I was, anyway?

389
00:21:38,807 --> 00:21:40,095
A guy that walks
into a good looking

390
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,184
dame's front parlor and says:

391
00:21:41,226 --> 00:21:43,228
"Good afternoon, I sell
accident insurance on husbands."

392
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,521
"You got one that's been
around too long?"

393
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:46,273
"One you'd like to turn into
a little hard cash?"

394
00:21:46,356 --> 00:21:48,316
"Just give me a smile
and I'll help you collect."

395
00:21:48,317 --> 00:21:51,987
Boy, what a dope you must think
I am. I think you're rotten.

396
00:21:52,071 --> 00:21:54,239
I think you're swell, so
long as I'm not your husband.

397
00:21:54,323 --> 00:21:57,243
Get out of here. You bet
I'll get out of here, baby.

398
00:21:57,326 --> 00:21:59,537
I'll get out of here, but quick.

399
00:22:09,505 --> 00:22:11,924
<i>So I let her have
it straight between the eyes.</i>

400
00:22:12,008 --> 00:22:14,552
<i>She didn't fool me
for a minute, not this time.</i>

401
00:22:14,761 --> 00:22:16,281
<i>I knew I had hold
of a red-hot poker...</i>

402
00:22:16,304 --> 00:22:19,057
<i>and the time to drop it was
before it burned my hand off.</i>

403
00:22:19,766 --> 00:22:21,701
<i>I stopped at a drive-in
for a bottle of</i>

404
00:22:21,726 --> 00:22:23,686
<i>beer, the one I had
wanted all along...</i>

405
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,714
<i>only I wanted it worse
now, to get rid</i>

406
00:22:25,739 --> 00:22:27,607
<i>of the sour taste
of her iced tea...</i>

407
00:22:27,691 --> 00:22:29,609
<i>and everything
that went with it.</i>

408
00:22:29,693 --> 00:22:31,339
<i>I didn't want to go
back to the office</i>

409
00:22:31,364 --> 00:22:32,863
<i>so I dropped by a
bowling alley...</i>

410
00:22:32,946 --> 00:22:35,449
<i>at Third and Western
and rolled a few lines...</i>

411
00:22:35,532 --> 00:22:38,618
<i>to get my mind thinking about
something else for a while.</i>

412
00:22:39,453 --> 00:22:41,638
<i>I didn't feel like
eating dinner when I</i>

413
00:22:41,663 --> 00:22:43,707
<i>left, and I didn't
feel like a show.</i>

414
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,169
<i>So, I drove home, put the car
away and went up to my apartment.</i>

415
00:22:49,004 --> 00:22:51,423
<i>It had begun to rain outside
and I watched it get dark...</i>

416
00:22:51,465 --> 00:22:53,550
<i>and didn't even
turn on the light.</i>

417
00:22:53,968 --> 00:22:55,427
<i>That didn't help me either.</i>

418
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,304
<i>I was all twisted up inside...</i>

419
00:22:57,388 --> 00:23:00,224
<i>and I was still holding on
to that red-hot poker.</i>

420
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:02,451
<i>And right then it
came over me that I</i>

421
00:23:02,476 --> 00:23:04,353
<i>hadn't walked out
on anything at all.</i>

422
00:23:04,562 --> 00:23:06,898
<i>That the hook was too strong...</i>

423
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:09,525
<i>that this wasn't the end
between her and me.</i>

424
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:11,277
<i>It was only the beginning.</i>

425
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:14,666
<i>So at 8:00 the bell
would ring and I'd know</i>

426
00:23:14,691 --> 00:23:16,783
<i>who it was without
even having to think.</i>

427
00:23:17,116 --> 00:23:19,786
<i>As if it was the most
natural thing in the world.</i>

428
00:23:23,498 --> 00:23:26,501
Hello. You forgot your hat
this afternoon.

429
00:23:27,294 --> 00:23:29,921
Did I? Don't you want me to bring it in?

430
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:31,756
Sure.

431
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,260
Put it on the chair.

432
00:23:43,977 --> 00:23:46,438
How'd you know where I live?
It's in the phone book.

433
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:49,024
It's raining. Yeah.

434
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:51,986
Peel off your coat and sit down.

435
00:23:55,072 --> 00:23:56,157
Your husband out?

436
00:23:56,198 --> 00:23:58,200
Yes. Long Beach. They're
spudding in a new well.

437
00:23:58,284 --> 00:24:00,453
He phoned he'd be late.
About 9:30.

438
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,831
It's about time you said
you were glad to see me.

439
00:24:03,873 --> 00:24:05,333
I knew you wouldn't
leave it like that.

440
00:24:05,374 --> 00:24:08,377
Like what?
Like it was this afternoon.

441
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:10,178
I must have said
something that gave

442
00:24:10,203 --> 00:24:11,756
you a terribly wrong impression.

443
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:14,717
You must never think anything
like that about me, Walter.

444
00:24:14,801 --> 00:24:16,052
Okay. No, it's not okay.

445
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:18,972
Not if you don't believe me.
What do you want me to do?

446
00:24:19,973 --> 00:24:21,683
I want you to be nice to me.

447
00:24:22,475 --> 00:24:24,978
Like the first time
you came to the house.

448
00:24:25,061 --> 00:24:27,272
It can't be like the first time.

449
00:24:27,355 --> 00:24:30,150
Something's happened.
I know it has.

450
00:24:30,942 --> 00:24:32,694
It's happened to us.

451
00:24:35,238 --> 00:24:39,243
I feel as if he was watching me.
Not that he cares. Not anymore.

452
00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:43,580
He keeps me on a leash
so tight I can't breathe.

453
00:24:43,622 --> 00:24:46,166
He's in Long Beach,
isn't he? Relax.

454
00:24:46,542 --> 00:24:48,544
Maybe I oughtn't to have come.

455
00:24:48,627 --> 00:24:51,338
Maybe you oughtn't.
You want me to go?

456
00:24:51,422 --> 00:24:53,716
If you want to. Right now?

457
00:24:53,757 --> 00:24:55,050
Sure, right now.

458
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,571
I'm crazy about you, baby.
I'm crazy about you, Walter.

459
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:17,407
That perfume on your hair.
What's the name of it?

460
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:20,410
I don't know.
I bought it in Ensenada.

461
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:23,705
You ought to have some of that
pink wine to go with it.

462
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,666
The kind that bubbles.
All I got is bourbon.

463
00:25:27,834 --> 00:25:29,711
Bourbon is fine, Walter.

464
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,637
Get a couple of glasses,
will you?

465
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,188
Club soda? Plain water, please.

466
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:51,616
You know, about six
months ago a guy slipped

467
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:53,068
on a cake of soap
in his bathtub...

468
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,446
and knocked himself cold
and was drowned.

469
00:25:55,946 --> 00:25:57,907
Only he had accident insurance.

470
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,493
So they had an autopsy and
she didn't get away with it.

471
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,662
Who didn't? His wife.

472
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:07,250
Then there was a case of a guy
who was found shot.

473
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:09,008
His wife said he
was cleaning a gun

474
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:10,545
and his stomach got in the way.

475
00:26:11,254 --> 00:26:14,257
All she collected was a
three-to-ten stretch in Tehachapi.

476
00:26:15,091 --> 00:26:17,135
Perhaps it was worth it to her.

477
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:21,973
See if you can carry that
as far as the living room.

478
00:26:25,852 --> 00:26:28,939
It's nice here, Walter.
Who takes care of it for you?

479
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:31,608
A colored woman comes in
a couple of times a week.

480
00:26:31,692 --> 00:26:34,736
Cook your own breakfast? Squeeze
a grapefruit once in a while.

481
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:37,739
Get the rest down at the corner
drugstore. Sounds wonderful.

482
00:26:37,823 --> 00:26:39,533
Just strangers beside you.

483
00:26:39,992 --> 00:26:42,327
You don't know them
and you don't hate them.

484
00:26:42,494 --> 00:26:43,996
You don't have to
sit across the table...

485
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:45,660
and smile at him
and that daughter

486
00:26:45,685 --> 00:26:47,291
of his every morning
of your life.

487
00:26:47,374 --> 00:26:50,628
What daughter? You mean the
little girl on the piano?

488
00:26:51,003 --> 00:26:52,713
Lola. She lives with us.

489
00:26:52,797 --> 00:26:55,341
He thinks a lot more of her
than he does of me.

490
00:26:55,716 --> 00:26:58,135
You ever think of a divorce?
He wouldn't give me a divorce.

491
00:26:58,219 --> 00:26:59,637
I suppose because it'd
cost him too much money.

492
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,045
He hasn't got any money.
Not since

493
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,270
he went into the oil business.

494
00:27:02,348 --> 00:27:04,100
But he had when you married him?

495
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,688
Yes, he had.
And I wanted a home. Why not?

496
00:27:09,898 --> 00:27:13,193
But that's not the only
reason. I was his wife's nurse.

497
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:15,077
She was sick a long time.
When she

498
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:16,863
died, he was terribly broken up.

499
00:27:18,281 --> 00:27:20,367
I pitied him so.
And now you hate him.

500
00:27:20,575 --> 00:27:23,370
Yes, Walter. He's so mean to me.

501
00:27:23,745 --> 00:27:25,093
Every time I buy a
dress or a pair

502
00:27:25,118 --> 00:27:26,373
of shoes he yells his head off.

503
00:27:26,456 --> 00:27:28,208
He never lets me go anywhere.
He keeps me shut up.

504
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,960
He's always been mean to me.

505
00:27:30,252 --> 00:27:33,922
Even his life insurance all
goes to that daughter of his.

506
00:27:34,756 --> 00:27:37,134
That Lola.
Nothing for you at all?

507
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:39,636
No. And nothing is just
what I'm worth to him.

508
00:27:40,721 --> 00:27:42,286
So you lie awake in the dark and

509
00:27:42,311 --> 00:27:44,099
listen to him snore
and get ideas.

510
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:47,186
Walter, I don't want
to kill him. I never did.

511
00:27:47,978 --> 00:27:50,564
Not even when he gets drunk
and slaps my face.

512
00:27:53,442 --> 00:27:56,487
Only sometimes you wish
he was dead. Perhaps I do.

513
00:27:56,571 --> 00:27:58,533
Then you wish it was
an accident, and

514
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:00,283
you had that policy for $50,000.

515
00:28:00,783 --> 00:28:02,910
Is that it? Perhaps that, too.

516
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:08,166
The other night we drove home
from a party. He was drunk again.

517
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:10,227
When we drove into the
garage, he just sat

518
00:28:10,252 --> 00:28:12,086
there with his head on
the steering wheel...

519
00:28:12,128 --> 00:28:13,880
and the motor still running.

520
00:28:14,381 --> 00:28:17,926
And I thought what it would be
like if I didn't switch it off...

521
00:28:18,802 --> 00:28:21,388
just closed the garage doors
and left him there.

522
00:28:21,471 --> 00:28:22,597
I'll tell you what it'd be like.

523
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:24,041
If you had that
accident policy and

524
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,290
tried to pull a monoxide job...

525
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:27,436
We've got a guy
in our office named Keyes.

526
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:29,061
For him a setup
like that'd be just

527
00:28:29,086 --> 00:28:30,522
like a slice of rare roast beef.

528
00:28:30,647 --> 00:28:32,441
In three minutes he'd know
it wasn't an accident.

529
00:28:32,482 --> 00:28:34,610
In 10 minutes you'd be sitting
under the hot lights.

530
00:28:34,651 --> 00:28:36,820
In a half-hour you'd be signing
your name to a confession.

531
00:28:36,904 --> 00:28:38,739
But, Walter, I didn't do it
and I'm not going to do it.

532
00:28:38,822 --> 00:28:41,075
Not if there's an insurance
company in the picture, baby.

533
00:28:41,158 --> 00:28:43,244
They know more tricks
than a carload of monkeys.

534
00:28:43,327 --> 00:28:45,847
And if there's a death mixed up
in it, you haven't got a prayer.

535
00:28:45,871 --> 00:28:48,958
They'll hang you just as sure
as ten dimes will buy a dollar.

536
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:51,293
And I don't want you
to hang, baby.

537
00:28:54,338 --> 00:28:56,299
Stop thinking about it,
will you?

538
00:28:59,844 --> 00:29:01,512
<i>So we just sat there.</i>

539
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:03,858
<i>She started crying
softly, like the rain</i>

540
00:29:03,883 --> 00:29:05,975
<i>on the window, and we
didn't say anything.</i>

541
00:29:06,226 --> 00:29:09,020
<i>Maybe she had stopped thinking
about it, but I hadn't.</i>

542
00:29:09,312 --> 00:29:10,313
I couldn't.

543
00:29:10,396 --> 00:29:12,173
Because it all tied
up with something

544
00:29:12,198 --> 00:29:13,858
I'd been thinking
about for years.

545
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,653
Since long before I ever
ran into Phyllis Dietrichson.

546
00:29:17,612 --> 00:29:19,573
Because you know
how it is, Keyes.

547
00:29:20,115 --> 00:29:21,283
In this business
you can't sleep...

548
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:24,202
for trying to figure out all the
tricks they could pull on you.

549
00:29:24,244 --> 00:29:25,704
You're like the guy
behind the roulette wheel...

550
00:29:25,787 --> 00:29:29,082
watching the customers to make
sure they don't crook the house.

551
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:31,185
And then one night,
you get to thinking

552
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,836
how you could crook
the house yourself.

553
00:29:32,878 --> 00:29:34,421
And do it smart.

554
00:29:34,505 --> 00:29:36,590
Because you've got that wheel
right under your hands.

555
00:29:36,673 --> 00:29:38,801
You know every notch in it
by heart.

556
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:41,554
And you figure all you need
is a plant out front.

557
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:43,681
A shill to put down the bet.

558
00:29:44,723 --> 00:29:45,850
And suddenly
the doorbell rings...

559
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:48,394
and the whole setup is right
there in the room with you.

560
00:29:52,231 --> 00:29:55,318
Look, Keyes, I'm not trying
to whitewash myself.

561
00:29:56,277 --> 00:29:59,739
I fought it, only I guess
I didn't fight it hard enough.

562
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:05,036
The stakes were $50,000, but
they were the life of a man, too.

563
00:30:05,995 --> 00:30:08,414
A man who'd never
done me any dirt, except...

564
00:30:09,124 --> 00:30:11,710
he was married to a woman
he didn't care anything about.

565
00:30:13,294 --> 00:30:14,504
<i>And I did.</i>

566
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:29,645
Will you phone me? Walter?

567
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:35,359
I hate him.
I loathe going back to him.

568
00:30:35,484 --> 00:30:38,362
You believe me, don't you,
Walter? Sure I believe you.

569
00:30:41,198 --> 00:30:44,326
I can't stand it anymore.
What if they did hang me?

570
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,746
They're not going
to hang you, baby.

571
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:48,372
It's better than
going on this way.

572
00:30:48,456 --> 00:30:49,582
They're not gonna
hang you because...

573
00:30:49,665 --> 00:30:51,459
you're gonna do it
and I'm gonna help you.

574
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:54,253
Do you know what you're saying?
Sure, I know what I'm saying.

575
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:55,797
We're gonna do it
and we're gonna do it right.

576
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,008
And I'm the guy that knows
how. Walter, you're hurting me.

577
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:00,725
There's not going
to be any slip-up.

578
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,095
Nothing sloppy. Nothing weak.

579
00:31:02,136 --> 00:31:03,596
It's got to be perfect.

580
00:31:16,443 --> 00:31:18,945
Call me tomorrow. But not
from your house. From a booth.

581
00:31:19,029 --> 00:31:20,906
And watch your step
every single minute.

582
00:31:20,989 --> 00:31:22,988
This has got to be
perfect, you understand?

583
00:31:23,013 --> 00:31:24,117
Straight down the line.

584
00:31:24,826 --> 00:31:27,329
Straight down the line.

585
00:32:09,873 --> 00:32:11,583
<i>That was it, Keyes.</i>

586
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:14,669
<i>The machinery had started to
move and nothing could stop it.</i>

587
00:32:15,378 --> 00:32:17,157
The first thing we
had to do was fix

588
00:32:17,182 --> 00:32:18,840
him up with that
accident policy.

589
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:21,247
I knew he wouldn't
buy, but all I wanted

590
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:23,053
was his signature
on an application.

591
00:32:23,595 --> 00:32:25,159
So I had to get him
to sign without

592
00:32:25,184 --> 00:32:26,640
his knowing what he was signing.

593
00:32:27,891 --> 00:32:29,664
And I wanted another
witness besides

594
00:32:29,689 --> 00:32:31,729
Phyllis to hear me
give him a sales talk.

595
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:34,189
I was trying to think
with your brains, Keyes...

596
00:32:34,273 --> 00:32:36,400
because I wanted
all the answers ready...

597
00:32:36,483 --> 00:32:38,623
for all the questions
you were gonna

598
00:32:38,648 --> 00:32:40,988
spring as soon as
Dietrichson was dead.

599
00:32:41,238 --> 00:32:43,532
A couple of nights later
I went to the house.

600
00:32:44,283 --> 00:32:46,277
Everything looked
fine, except I didn't

601
00:32:46,302 --> 00:32:48,371
like the witness Phyllis
had brought in.

602
00:32:48,788 --> 00:32:50,915
It was Dietrichson's
daughter, Lola.

603
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,502
And it made me feel
a little queer in the belly...

604
00:32:54,585 --> 00:32:56,187
to have her sitting
right there in the

605
00:32:56,212 --> 00:32:57,630
room, playing
Chinese checkers...

606
00:32:58,715 --> 00:33:00,300
<i>as if nothing
were going to happen.</i>

607
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,887
I suppose you
realize, Mr. Dietrichson...

608
00:33:03,928 --> 00:33:05,221
that, not being an employee...

609
00:33:05,305 --> 00:33:07,665
you are not covered by the
State Compensation Insurance Act.

610
00:33:07,682 --> 00:33:09,305
The only way you can
protect yourself is

611
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,977
by having a personal
policy of your own.

612
00:33:11,061 --> 00:33:12,229
Yeah, I know all about that.

613
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,790
The next thing
you'll tell me I need...

614
00:33:13,814 --> 00:33:17,359
earthquake insurance and lightning
insurance and hail insurance.

615
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:19,152
If we bought all the insurance
they can think up...

616
00:33:19,236 --> 00:33:21,029
we'd stay broke paying
for it, wouldn't we, honey?

617
00:33:21,113 --> 00:33:23,116
What keeps us broke
is you going out

618
00:33:23,141 --> 00:33:24,950
and buying five hats at a crack.

619
00:33:25,033 --> 00:33:26,743
Who needs a hat in California?

620
00:33:26,785 --> 00:33:28,495
Dollar for dollar,
Mr. Dietrichson...

621
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:30,998
accident insurance is the
cheapest coverage you can buy.

622
00:33:31,081 --> 00:33:33,959
Well, maybe some other time,
Mr. Neff. I had a tough day.

623
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:35,085
Just as you say.

624
00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:37,963
Suppose we just settle that
automobile insurance tonight.

625
00:33:38,089 --> 00:33:39,256
Sure.

626
00:33:39,507 --> 00:33:41,264
All we'll need on
that is for you to

627
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:42,927
sign the application
for renewal.

628
00:33:43,052 --> 00:33:44,887
Phyllis, do you mind
if we don't finish this game?

629
00:33:44,971 --> 00:33:47,306
It bores me stiff.
Got something better to do?

630
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,641
Yes, I have.

631
00:33:49,934 --> 00:33:51,769
Father, is it all right
if I run along now?

632
00:33:51,811 --> 00:33:53,587
Run along where? Who with?
Just Anne.

633
00:33:53,612 --> 00:33:54,939
We're going roller-skating.

634
00:33:55,023 --> 00:33:56,774
Anne who? Anne Matthews.

635
00:33:56,858 --> 00:33:58,818
It's not that Nino
Zachetti again, is it?

636
00:33:58,902 --> 00:34:00,320
It better not be
that Zachetti guy.

637
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:01,641
If I ever catch you with that...

638
00:34:01,654 --> 00:34:03,031
It's Anne Matthews, I told you.

639
00:34:03,114 --> 00:34:05,200
And I also told you
we're going roller-skating.

640
00:34:05,283 --> 00:34:06,860
I'm meeting her at the
corner of Vermont

641
00:34:06,885 --> 00:34:08,370
and Franklin, the
northwest corner...

642
00:34:08,453 --> 00:34:10,914
in case you're interested,
and I'm late already.

643
00:34:10,997 --> 00:34:13,542
I hope that's all quite clear.
Good night, Father.

644
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:15,961
Good night, Phyllis. Good
night, Miss Dietrichson.

645
00:34:16,044 --> 00:34:18,046
I'm sorry. Good night, Mr... Neff.

646
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,798
Good night, Mr. Neff.

647
00:34:22,843 --> 00:34:24,803
A great little fighter
for her weight.

648
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,307
Now, if you'll just
sign these, Mr. Dietrichson.

649
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:30,768
Sign what? The applications
for the auto renewals.

650
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:32,811
So you'll be covered until
the new policies are issued.

651
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:34,563
When will that be? About a week.

652
00:34:34,647 --> 00:34:36,565
Just so I'm covered
when I drive up north.

653
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:38,484
San Francisco? Palo Alto.

654
00:34:38,526 --> 00:34:40,277
He was a Stanford man, Mr. Neff.

655
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:42,780
And he still goes to his
class reunion every year.

656
00:34:42,863 --> 00:34:44,739
What's wrong with that?
Can't I have

657
00:34:44,764 --> 00:34:46,409
a little fun, even once a year?

658
00:34:46,492 --> 00:34:48,161
Great football school, Stanford.

659
00:34:48,202 --> 00:34:50,204
Did you play football, Mr.
Dietrichson? Left guard.

660
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,914
Almost made the varsity, too.
Where do I sign?

661
00:34:51,998 --> 00:34:53,333
The bottom line.

662
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,006
Both copies, please. Sign twice?

663
00:35:00,048 --> 00:35:01,341
Yes. One is the agent's copy.

664
00:35:01,424 --> 00:35:05,387
I need it for my files.
Files. Duplicates. Triplicates.

665
00:35:11,143 --> 00:35:12,602
Thank you, Mr. Dietrichson.

666
00:35:12,686 --> 00:35:14,174
Don't worry about the
check, I can pick

667
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:15,522
it up at your office
some morning.

668
00:35:15,564 --> 00:35:17,816
How much you taking me for?
$147.50.

669
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,569
I think that's enough insurance
for one evening, Mr. Neff.

670
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:21,862
Plenty.

671
00:35:25,741 --> 00:35:27,522
Bring me some soda when
you come up, Phyllis.

672
00:35:27,547 --> 00:35:28,410
Good night, Mr. Neff.

673
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:29,536
Good night, Mr. Dietrichson.

674
00:35:29,578 --> 00:35:32,206
I think you left your hat
in the hall, Mr. Neff.

675
00:35:47,722 --> 00:35:49,515
Good night, Mr. Neff.

676
00:35:52,185 --> 00:35:53,394
All right, Walter? Fine.

677
00:35:53,436 --> 00:35:55,355
He signed it, didn't he? Sure
he signed it. You saw him.

678
00:35:55,438 --> 00:35:57,357
Now, listen. That trip to
Palo Alto. When does he leave?

679
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,440
End of the month.

680
00:35:58,483 --> 00:35:59,563
He drives? He always drives.

681
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:01,194
Not this time. You're gonna
make him take the train.

682
00:36:01,277 --> 00:36:02,821
Why? Because it's all
worked out for a train.

683
00:36:02,904 --> 00:36:05,282
Listen, baby. There's a clause
in every accident policy...

684
00:36:05,323 --> 00:36:07,200
a little thing called
double indemnity.

685
00:36:07,284 --> 00:36:08,698
The insurance companies
put it in as

686
00:36:08,723 --> 00:36:10,162
a sort of come-on
for the customers.

687
00:36:10,245 --> 00:36:12,414
That means they pay double
on certain accidents.

688
00:36:12,456 --> 00:36:14,082
The kind that almost
never happen.

689
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,668
Like for instance, if a guy
is killed on the train...

690
00:36:16,752 --> 00:36:19,171
they pay $100,000
instead of $50,000.

691
00:36:19,254 --> 00:36:21,673
I see. We're hitting
it for the limit, baby.

692
00:36:21,757 --> 00:36:24,259
That's why
it's got to be the train.

693
00:36:25,594 --> 00:36:28,430
It'll be the train, Walter.
Just the way you want it.

694
00:36:28,472 --> 00:36:30,391
Straight down the line.

695
00:36:49,786 --> 00:36:51,371
Hello, Mr. Neff.

696
00:36:52,789 --> 00:36:53,998
It's me.

697
00:36:54,749 --> 00:36:57,127
Is anything wrong?
I've been waiting for you.

698
00:36:57,168 --> 00:36:58,294
For me? Why?

699
00:36:58,336 --> 00:36:59,859
I thought you could let me ride

700
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,631
with you, if you're
going my way.

701
00:37:06,803 --> 00:37:10,265
Which way would that be?
Down the hill. Down Vermont.

702
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:13,310
Sure. Vermont and Franklin.
Northwest corner, wasn't it?

703
00:37:13,393 --> 00:37:14,728
Be glad to, Miss Dietrichson.

704
00:37:19,191 --> 00:37:21,151
Going roller-skating?

705
00:37:21,276 --> 00:37:24,655
You like roller-skating?
I can take it or leave it.

706
00:37:25,823 --> 00:37:28,701
Only tonight you're
leaving it? Yes, I am.

707
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,747
I'm having
a very tough time at home.

708
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:36,208
My father doesn't understand
me and Phyllis hates me.

709
00:37:36,626 --> 00:37:40,171
Sounds tough, all right. That's
why I have to lie sometimes.

710
00:37:40,213 --> 00:37:41,631
You mean it's not
Vermont and Franklin?

711
00:37:41,714 --> 00:37:43,633
It's Vermont and Franklin
all right.

712
00:37:43,716 --> 00:37:46,844
Only it's not Anne Matthews.
It's Nino Zachetti.

713
00:37:48,012 --> 00:37:49,973
You won't tell on me, will you?

714
00:37:50,056 --> 00:37:51,428
I'd have to think it over.
Nino's

715
00:37:51,453 --> 00:37:52,767
not what my father says at all.

716
00:37:52,851 --> 00:37:55,937
He's just had bad luck.
He was doing premed at USC...

717
00:37:56,021 --> 00:37:58,982
and working nights as an usher
in a theater downtown.

718
00:37:59,065 --> 00:38:01,693
Got behind in his credits,
flunked out.

719
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,822
Then he lost his job for
talking back. He's so hot-headed.

720
00:38:07,032 --> 00:38:08,325
Becomes expensive, doesn't it?

721
00:38:08,408 --> 00:38:10,888
Guess my father thinks nobody's
good enough for his daughter...

722
00:38:10,953 --> 00:38:13,205
except maybe the guy that
owns Standard Oil.

723
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:17,042
I wish he'd see it my way.
I can't give Nino up.

724
00:38:18,419 --> 00:38:20,629
It'll all straighten out,
Miss Dietrichson.

725
00:38:20,713 --> 00:38:22,864
I suppose it will sometime.
This is

726
00:38:22,889 --> 00:38:24,884
the corner right here, Mr. Neff.

727
00:38:27,303 --> 00:38:30,056
Nino? Over here, Nino.

728
00:38:38,773 --> 00:38:41,317
This is Mr. Neff, Nino.
Hello, Nino.

729
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:43,027
The name is Zachetti.

730
00:38:43,111 --> 00:38:45,738
Nino, please. Mr. Neff gave
me a ride from the house.

731
00:38:45,822 --> 00:38:46,906
I told him all about us.

732
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,366
Why does he have to
get told about us?

733
00:38:48,449 --> 00:38:50,410
We don't have to worry
about Mr. Neff, Nino.

734
00:38:50,493 --> 00:38:52,078
I'm not doing any worrying.

735
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,413
Just don't you
broadcast so much.

736
00:38:53,496 --> 00:38:55,248
Well, what's the matter
with you, Nino?

737
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,792
Why, he's a friend.
I don't have any friends.

738
00:38:57,876 --> 00:39:00,128
If I did, I like to pick
them myself. Come on.

739
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:02,547
Look, sonny, she needed a
ride, so I brought her along.

740
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,758
Is that anything
to get tough about?

741
00:39:04,841 --> 00:39:06,158
All right, Lola,
make up your mind.

742
00:39:06,183 --> 00:39:07,343
Are you coming or aren't you?

743
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,179
Of course I'm coming.

744
00:39:11,723 --> 00:39:15,018
Don't mind him, Mr. Neff.
And thanks a lot for the ride.

745
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:17,438
You're awfully sweet. Nino?

746
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,528
<i>She was a nice kid.</i>

747
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,782
<i>Maybe he was a little better
than he sounded.</i>

748
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,662
<i>But right then it gave
me a nasty feeling</i>

749
00:39:29,687 --> 00:39:31,285
<i>to be thinking about
them at all...</i>

750
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:33,158
<i>with that briefcase
right behind my head</i>

751
00:39:33,183 --> 00:39:35,039
<i>that had her father's
signature in it...</i>

752
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,250
<i>and what that signature meant.</i>

753
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,544
<i>It meant he was a dead pigeon.</i>

754
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:43,673
<i>It was only a question of time,
and not very much time at that.</i>

755
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,467
<i>You know that big market
up on Los Feliz, Keyes?</i>

756
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,805
<i>That's the place Phyllis and I
had picked for a meeting place.</i>

757
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:52,974
<i>I already had most of
the plan in my head...</i>

758
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:55,310
<i>but a lot of details
had to be worked out.</i>

759
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,980
<i>And she had to know them all
by heart when the time came.</i>

760
00:39:59,356 --> 00:40:01,983
<i>We had to be very careful
from now on.</i>

761
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:04,778
<i>We couldn't let anybody
see us together.</i>

762
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,739
<i>We couldn't even talk to
each other on the telephone.</i>

763
00:40:07,823 --> 00:40:10,701
<i>Not from her house
or at my office, anyway.</i>

764
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,571
<i>So she was to be in
the market every</i>

765
00:40:13,596 --> 00:40:15,664
<i>morning about 11:00,
buying stuff.</i>

766
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:19,376
<i>And I could sort of run into
her there any day I wanted to.</i>

767
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:21,754
<i>Sort of accidentally on purpose.</i>

768
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,132
Walter, I wanted to...
Not so loud.

769
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,260
I wanted to talk to you,
ever since yesterday.

770
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:30,471
Let me talk first. It's all set.

771
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:33,015
The accident policy came
through. I've got it in my pocket.

772
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:36,060
I got his check, too. I saw
him down in the oil fields.

773
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:38,229
He thought he was paying
for the auto insurance.

774
00:40:38,312 --> 00:40:39,592
The check's just made out to the

775
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:41,190
company, so it could
be for anything.

776
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:44,027
But you have to send a check
for the auto insurance, see?

777
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:47,197
It.

778
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:49,032
Open your bag. Quick.

779
00:40:54,204 --> 00:40:55,604
Can you get in
the safe-deposit box?

780
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:57,666
Yes. We both have keys. Fine.

781
00:40:57,749 --> 00:41:00,043
But don't put the policy in
there yet. I'll tell you when.

782
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:01,533
Remember, you never
saw it, you never

783
00:41:01,558 --> 00:41:02,838
even touched it, you understand?

784
00:41:02,921 --> 00:41:05,507
I'm not a fool. Okay. When
is he leaving on the train?

785
00:41:05,591 --> 00:41:07,071
That's just it. He isn't going. What?

786
00:41:07,092 --> 00:41:09,011
That's what I've been trying
to tell you. The trip is off.

787
00:41:09,094 --> 00:41:10,679
What happened?

788
00:41:12,264 --> 00:41:15,267
Mister, could you reach me
that package of baby food?

789
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:16,977
That one up there?

790
00:41:18,938 --> 00:41:22,733
I don't know why they always
put what I want on the top shelf.

791
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:25,736
Go ahead. I'm listening.

792
00:41:25,778 --> 00:41:28,218
He had a fall-down at the well.
Broke his leg. It's in a cast.

793
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:30,950
Broke his leg?
What do we do now, Walter?

794
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:33,661
Nothing. We just wait.
Wait for what?

795
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:35,204
Until he can take the train.

796
00:41:35,288 --> 00:41:36,497
I told you it's got
to be the train.

797
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:37,915
But we can't wait.
I can't go on like this.

798
00:41:37,957 --> 00:41:39,477
Look, we're not gonna
grab a hammer and

799
00:41:39,478 --> 00:41:40,960
do it quick, just to
get it over with.

800
00:41:41,044 --> 00:41:43,796
There are other ways. We're
not gonna do it other ways.

801
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,964
But we can't leave it like this.

802
00:41:45,048 --> 00:41:46,528
What do you suppose
would happen if he

803
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:47,967
found out about the
accident policy?

804
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:50,171
Plenty. But not as bad as
sitting in that death house.

805
00:41:50,178 --> 00:41:51,606
Don't ever talk like that.
Don't let's

806
00:41:51,631 --> 00:41:52,991
start losing our
heads, that's all.

807
00:41:53,056 --> 00:41:55,267
It's not our heads.
It's our nerve we're losing.

808
00:41:59,146 --> 00:42:00,480
Excuse me.

809
00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:05,193
We're gonna do it right.
That's all I said.

810
00:42:05,277 --> 00:42:06,737
It's the waiting
that's getting me.

811
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,322
It's getting me
just as bad, baby.

812
00:42:08,363 --> 00:42:11,408
But we've got to wait.
Maybe we have, Walter, only...

813
00:42:11,492 --> 00:42:14,912
it's so tough without you.
It's like a wall between us.

814
00:42:16,747 --> 00:42:20,042
I better go, baby. I'm
thinking of you every minute.

815
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:27,733
<i>After that, a full week</i>

816
00:42:27,758 --> 00:42:29,635
<i>went by and I didn't
see her once.</i>

817
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,222
<i>I tried to keep my mind off
her and off the whole idea.</i>

818
00:42:33,347 --> 00:42:34,867
<i>I kept telling myself
that maybe those.</i>

819
00:42:34,884 --> 00:42:36,184
<i>Fates they say watch over you...</i>

820
00:42:36,267 --> 00:42:39,979
<i>had gotten together and broken
his leg to give me a way out.</i>

821
00:42:40,104 --> 00:42:44,067
<i>Then it was the 15th of June.
You may remember that date, Keyes.</i>

822
00:42:45,485 --> 00:42:48,822
<i>You came into my office
around 3:00 in the afternoon.</i>

823
00:42:49,489 --> 00:42:50,782
Hello, Keyes.

824
00:42:50,865 --> 00:42:52,145
I just came
from Norton's office.

825
00:42:52,158 --> 00:42:53,618
The semiannual sales
records are out.

826
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:56,621
You're high man, Walter. That's
twice in a row. Congratulations.

827
00:42:56,705 --> 00:42:59,374
Thanks. How would you
like a cheap drink?

828
00:42:59,458 --> 00:43:01,960
How would you like
a $50 cut in salary?

829
00:43:02,044 --> 00:43:04,364
Do I laugh now or wait till
it gets funny? No, I'm serious.

830
00:43:04,379 --> 00:43:06,118
I've just been talking to Norton.
Too

831
00:43:06,143 --> 00:43:07,674
much stuff piling up on my desk.

832
00:43:07,716 --> 00:43:09,051
Too much pressure on my nerves.

833
00:43:09,134 --> 00:43:11,214
I spend half the night
walking up and down in my bed.

834
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,220
I've got to have an assistant
and I thought of you.

835
00:43:13,222 --> 00:43:14,598
Me? Why pick on me?

836
00:43:14,682 --> 00:43:15,794
Well, because I've got a crazy

837
00:43:15,819 --> 00:43:17,184
idea you might be
good at the job.

838
00:43:17,268 --> 00:43:18,686
That's crazy, all right.
I'm a salesman.

839
00:43:18,727 --> 00:43:21,939
Yeah. A peddler,
a gladhander, a backslapper.

840
00:43:22,523 --> 00:43:23,803
You're too good
to be a salesman.

841
00:43:23,858 --> 00:43:25,985
Nobody's too good to
be a salesman. Phooey!

842
00:43:26,068 --> 00:43:27,858
All you guys do is just
ring doorbells and

843
00:43:27,883 --> 00:43:29,530
dish out a smooth
line of monkey talk.

844
00:43:29,614 --> 00:43:31,783
What's troubling you
is that $50 cut, isn't it?

845
00:43:31,866 --> 00:43:33,368
Well, that'd trouble anybody.
Now look, Walter.

846
00:43:33,451 --> 00:43:36,412
The job I'm talking about
takes brains and integrity.

847
00:43:36,496 --> 00:43:38,414
It takes more guts than
there is in 50 salesmen.

848
00:43:38,456 --> 00:43:39,582
It's the hottest job
in the business.

849
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:40,946
Yeah, but it's still a desk job.

850
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:43,086
I don't want to be nailed
to a desk. Desk job?

851
00:43:43,169 --> 00:43:44,754
Is that all you can see in it?

852
00:43:44,838 --> 00:43:47,799
Just a hard chair to park your
pants on from 9:00 to 5:00?

853
00:43:47,882 --> 00:43:49,162
Just a pile of papers to shuffle

854
00:43:49,177 --> 00:43:50,594
around, and five
sharp pencils...

855
00:43:50,677 --> 00:43:52,871
and a scratch pad
to make figures on,

856
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:55,057
maybe a little
doodling on the side.

857
00:43:55,098 --> 00:43:57,142
Well, that's not the way
I look at it, Walter.

858
00:43:57,225 --> 00:43:59,214
To me, a claims
man is a surgeon,

859
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:01,313
that desk is an
operating table...

860
00:44:01,396 --> 00:44:04,233
and those pencils are scalpels
and bone chisels.

861
00:44:04,274 --> 00:44:06,147
And those papers are
not just forms and

862
00:44:06,172 --> 00:44:08,070
statistics and claims
for compensation.

863
00:44:08,153 --> 00:44:11,282
They're alive.
They're packed with drama...

864
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:13,701
with twisted hopes
and crooked dreams.

865
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:16,996
A claims man, Walter, is a
doctor and a bloodhound and a...

866
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:21,584
Who? Okay, hold on a minute.

867
00:44:21,876 --> 00:44:23,535
A claims man is a
doctor and a bloodhound

868
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,004
and a cop and a
judge and a jury...

869
00:44:25,087 --> 00:44:26,756
and a father confessor,
all in one.

870
00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:28,424
And you want to tell me
you're not interested?

871
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:29,634
You don't want to work
with your brains?

872
00:44:29,717 --> 00:44:31,761
All you want to work is with
your finger on the doorbell...

873
00:44:31,844 --> 00:44:35,390
for a few bucks more a week.
There's a dame on your phone.

874
00:44:35,473 --> 00:44:37,976
Walter Neff speaking.
I had to call you, Walter.

875
00:44:38,059 --> 00:44:39,619
It's very urgent.
Are you with somebody?

876
00:44:40,937 --> 00:44:44,065
Yes, I am.
Can't I call you back, Margie?

877
00:44:44,774 --> 00:44:47,944
No, you can't. I've only
got a minute. It can't wait.

878
00:44:48,028 --> 00:44:51,323
Listen. He's going tonight. On
the train. Are you listening?

879
00:44:51,406 --> 00:44:53,992
Walter?
Yeah. I'm listening, Margie.

880
00:44:54,701 --> 00:44:57,245
Only, make it snappy,
will you? He's on crutches.

881
00:44:57,329 --> 00:44:59,272
The doctor says he can
go if he's careful.

882
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:00,624
The change will do him good.

883
00:45:00,707 --> 00:45:03,460
It's wonderful, Walter. Just the
way you wanted it, on a train.

884
00:45:03,544 --> 00:45:06,130
Only with the crutches it makes
it much better, doesn't it?

885
00:45:06,171 --> 00:45:08,632
Yeah. Yeah, that's 100% better.

886
00:45:10,217 --> 00:45:11,510
Hold the line a minute,
will you?

887
00:45:11,594 --> 00:45:13,194
Keyes, suppose I join
you in your office?

888
00:45:13,198 --> 00:45:14,318
That's all right. I'll wait.

889
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:16,849
Only tell her
not to take all day.

890
00:45:18,601 --> 00:45:19,727
Go ahead.

891
00:45:20,061 --> 00:45:23,147
It's the 10:15 from Glendale.
I'm driving him.

892
00:45:23,189 --> 00:45:25,024
It's still the same
dark street, isn't it?

893
00:45:25,107 --> 00:45:28,361
And the signal is three honks
on the horn. Okay. Anything else?

894
00:45:29,153 --> 00:45:30,154
No.

895
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,616
What color did you pick?

896
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:36,578
Blue. Navy blue. And the
cast is on his left leg.

897
00:45:39,038 --> 00:45:40,582
Yeah, that suits me fine.

898
00:45:40,665 --> 00:45:42,917
This is it, Walter.
I'm shaking like a leaf.

899
00:45:43,001 --> 00:45:46,004
But it's straight down
the line for both of us.

900
00:45:46,087 --> 00:45:48,215
I love you, Walter. Goodbye.

901
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,219
Sorry, Keyes. What's the matter?

902
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:55,013
Dames chasing you again? Or still?
Or is it none of my business?

903
00:45:55,055 --> 00:45:56,932
If I told you
it was a customer...

904
00:45:57,099 --> 00:45:59,184
Margie. I bet she drinks
from the bottle.

905
00:45:59,226 --> 00:46:01,103
Why don't you settle down
and get married, Walter?

906
00:46:01,186 --> 00:46:05,232
Why don't you, for instance? I
almost did, once. Long time ago.

907
00:46:05,316 --> 00:46:07,067
Now look, Keyes, I've
got to call on a prospect.

908
00:46:07,151 --> 00:46:09,653
Even had the church
picked out, the dame and I.

909
00:46:09,737 --> 00:46:11,989
She had a white satin dress
with flounces on it.

910
00:46:12,072 --> 00:46:14,867
I was on my way to the
jewelry store to buy the ring.

911
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:17,536
And then suddenly that little
man in here started working on me.

912
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:19,163
So you went back
and had her investigated?

913
00:46:19,247 --> 00:46:21,666
Yeah. And the stuff
that came out...

914
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:25,002
She'd been dyeing her hair
ever since she was 16.

915
00:46:25,086 --> 00:46:26,236
There was a manic depressive in

916
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:27,588
her family, on her
mother's side.

917
00:46:27,672 --> 00:46:29,299
She already had one husband.

918
00:46:29,382 --> 00:46:31,467
He was a professional
pool player in Baltimore.

919
00:46:31,551 --> 00:46:33,595
And as for her brother...
I get the general idea.

920
00:46:33,678 --> 00:46:35,871
She was a tramp from a
long line of tramps.

921
00:46:35,896 --> 00:46:37,307
Yeah. All right, all right.

922
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:40,101
Now what do I say to Norton? What
about this job I want you for?

923
00:46:40,185 --> 00:46:41,728
I don't think I want it, Keyes.

924
00:46:41,811 --> 00:46:44,314
Thanks just the same.
Fair enough.

925
00:46:45,273 --> 00:46:47,484
Only get this,
I picked you for the job...

926
00:46:47,567 --> 00:46:49,736
not because I think
you're so darn smart...

927
00:46:49,778 --> 00:46:51,422
but because I thought
you were a shade

928
00:46:51,447 --> 00:46:53,115
less dumb than the
rest of the outfit.

929
00:47:00,289 --> 00:47:03,292
Guess I was wrong.
You're not smarter, Walter.

930
00:47:03,542 --> 00:47:05,669
You're just a little taller.

931
00:47:16,597 --> 00:47:17,932
<i>Yes, Keyes.</i>

932
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,602
<i>Those Fates I was talking about
had only been stalling me off.</i>

933
00:47:21,686 --> 00:47:25,064
<i>Now they had thrown the
switch. The gears had meshed.</i>

934
00:47:25,148 --> 00:47:27,775
<i>The time for thinking
had all run out.</i>

935
00:47:28,526 --> 00:47:30,488
<i>I wanted my movements
accounted for</i>

936
00:47:30,513 --> 00:47:32,280
<i>up to the last possible moment.</i>

937
00:47:32,322 --> 00:47:34,287
<i>So when I left the
office I put my rate</i>

938
00:47:34,312 --> 00:47:36,451
<i>book on the desk as if
I had forgotten it.</i>

939
00:47:36,534 --> 00:47:38,578
<i>That was part of my alibi.</i>

940
00:47:39,996 --> 00:47:42,749
<i>From here on, it was a question
of following the timetable...</i>

941
00:47:42,832 --> 00:47:43,834
<i>move by move.</i>

942
00:47:45,669 --> 00:47:48,797
<i>I got home about 7:00 and
drove right into the garage.</i>

943
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:51,800
<i>This was another item
to establish my alibi.</i>

944
00:47:53,176 --> 00:47:55,470
Hi, Mr. Neff. Hello, Charlie.

945
00:47:55,512 --> 00:47:57,347
How about giving
the heap a wash job?

946
00:47:57,431 --> 00:47:58,599
How soon you gonna want it?

947
00:47:58,682 --> 00:48:00,059
I got a couple cars
ahead of you.

948
00:48:00,142 --> 00:48:01,644
Any time you get to it, Charlie.

949
00:48:01,727 --> 00:48:03,979
I'm staying in tonight. Okay.

950
00:48:04,063 --> 00:48:06,023
<i>Up in my apartment
I called Lou Schwartz...</i>

951
00:48:06,106 --> 00:48:08,400
<i>one of the salesmen
that shared my office.</i>

952
00:48:08,484 --> 00:48:10,216
<i>He lived in Westwood,
so it was a toll</i>

953
00:48:10,241 --> 00:48:11,862
<i>call and there'd
be a record of it.</i>

954
00:48:11,946 --> 00:48:14,240
<i>I told him I'd forgotten my
rate book and needed some dope...</i>

955
00:48:14,323 --> 00:48:17,243
<i>on the public liability bond
I was figuring.</i>

956
00:48:17,368 --> 00:48:19,074
<i>I changed into a navy blue suit</i>

957
00:48:19,099 --> 00:48:21,164
<i>like Dietrichson
was going to wear.</i>

958
00:48:21,205 --> 00:48:24,334
<i>Lou Schwartz called me back
and gave me a lot of figures.</i>

959
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:26,836
<i>I stuffed a hand towel and a roll
of adhesive into my pockets...</i>

960
00:48:26,878 --> 00:48:28,646
<i>so I could fake something that</i>

961
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,882
<i>looked like a cast
on a broken leg.</i>

962
00:48:30,965 --> 00:48:33,009
<i>Next, I stuck a card
inside the telephone box...</i>

963
00:48:33,051 --> 00:48:35,887
<i>so that it would fall down
if the bell rang.</i>

964
00:48:35,970 --> 00:48:39,474
<i>That way I'd know if anybody
had called me while I was away.</i>

965
00:48:39,558 --> 00:48:41,336
<i>Then I did the same thing to the</i>

966
00:48:41,361 --> 00:48:43,728
<i>doorbell in case anybody
came to see me.</i>

967
00:48:44,229 --> 00:48:47,858
<i>I left the apartment by the
service stairs. Nobody saw me.</i>

968
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,154
<i>I walked all the way from my
apartment to the Dietrichson house.</i>

969
00:48:52,237 --> 00:48:53,572
<i>I didn't want to take the bus...</i>

970
00:48:53,655 --> 00:48:55,488
<i>because there was
always the chance that</i>

971
00:48:55,513 --> 00:48:57,326
<i>someone might remember
seeing me on it.</i>

972
00:48:57,409 --> 00:48:59,370
<i>I was being that careful.</i>

973
00:48:59,787 --> 00:49:02,373
<i>I could smell that
honeysuckle again.</i>

974
00:49:02,498 --> 00:49:05,668
<i>Only it was even stronger,
now that it was night.</i>

975
00:49:10,089 --> 00:49:13,259
<i>I slid the garage door open
as quietly as I could.</i>

976
00:49:13,593 --> 00:49:16,679
<i>She'd backed the sedan in,
just the way I told her to.</i>

977
00:49:16,762 --> 00:49:18,222
<i>I'd figured it was
safer that way...</i>

978
00:49:18,306 --> 00:49:21,392
<i>in case he got into the car
before she drove it out.</i>

979
00:49:21,434 --> 00:49:23,728
<i>I got into the back of the car.</i>

980
00:49:23,811 --> 00:49:26,272
<i>I lay there on the floor
and waited.</i>

981
00:49:26,356 --> 00:49:27,836
<i>All the time I was
thinking about that</i>

982
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:29,442
<i>dark street on the way
to the station...</i>

983
00:49:29,526 --> 00:49:31,319
<i>where I was to do it...</i>

984
00:49:31,403 --> 00:49:34,155
<i>and the three honks on the
horn that were to be the signal.</i>

985
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:36,616
<i>About 10 minutes later
they came down.</i>

986
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,410
All right, honey?
Yeah, I'm all right.

987
00:49:38,493 --> 00:49:40,954
I'll have the car out
in a second.

988
00:50:17,742 --> 00:50:21,037
Take it easy, honey. We've
got lots of time. Yeah.

989
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:42,476
Remember what the doctor said.
If you get careless...

990
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,311
you might end up
with a shorter leg.

991
00:50:44,353 --> 00:50:48,148
So what? I could break the other
one and match them up again.

992
00:50:48,524 --> 00:50:51,026
It makes you feel pretty good
to get away from me, doesn't it?

993
00:50:51,110 --> 00:50:54,822
It's only for four days. I'll
be back Monday at the latest.

994
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,175
This is not the right street.
Why did you turn here?

995
00:51:18,137 --> 00:51:20,264
What are you doing that for?

996
00:51:21,266 --> 00:51:23,726
What are you
honking the horn for?

997
00:52:23,913 --> 00:52:25,874
You take care of the redcap
and the conductor.

998
00:52:25,957 --> 00:52:28,293
Don't worry. Keep away
from me as much as you can.

999
00:52:28,376 --> 00:52:29,731
Tell them I don't
want to be helped.

1000
00:52:29,756 --> 00:52:30,876
I said, don't worry, Walter.

1001
00:52:30,921 --> 00:52:33,131
You start as soon as
the train leaves.

1002
00:52:33,215 --> 00:52:34,506
When you get to the
refinery, turn

1003
00:52:34,531 --> 00:52:35,891
off the highway
onto the dirt road.

1004
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,511
From there it's exactly
eight-tenths of a mile...

1005
00:52:37,594 --> 00:52:39,012
to the dump beside the tracks.
Remember.

1006
00:52:39,096 --> 00:52:41,598
I remember everything.
No speeding.

1007
00:52:42,975 --> 00:52:45,644
You don't want any cops stopping
you with him in the back.

1008
00:52:45,727 --> 00:52:48,105
Walter, we've been through
all that so many times.

1009
00:52:48,147 --> 00:52:50,441
When you leave the highway,
turn off all your lights.

1010
00:52:50,524 --> 00:52:52,609
I'll be back on
the observation platform.

1011
00:52:52,693 --> 00:52:55,362
I'll drop off as close to
the spot as I can.

1012
00:52:55,446 --> 00:52:58,491
Let the train pass,
then dim your lights twice.

1013
00:53:01,035 --> 00:53:03,996
San Francisco train, lady? Car
9, section 11. Just my husband.

1014
00:53:04,038 --> 00:53:06,540
Car 9, section 11?
This way please.

1015
00:53:14,632 --> 00:53:16,551
Thank you. My husband
doesn't like to be helped.

1016
00:53:16,634 --> 00:53:18,469
Car number 8. Up there.

1017
00:53:23,808 --> 00:53:27,395
Car 9, section 11. Thank you.

1018
00:53:30,023 --> 00:53:32,463
Here're the tickets. Take good
care of yourself with that leg.

1019
00:53:32,484 --> 00:53:33,884
Yeah. You take it easy
driving home.

1020
00:53:33,902 --> 00:53:37,364
I'll miss you, honey.
Section 11, sir.

1021
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:41,118
All aboard! Thank you.

1022
00:53:41,201 --> 00:53:43,328
Goodbye, honey. All aboard!

1023
00:53:49,168 --> 00:53:50,794
Good luck, honey.

1024
00:53:59,387 --> 00:54:01,013
Porter, will you make up
my berth right away?

1025
00:54:01,055 --> 00:54:02,139
Yes, sir.

1026
00:54:02,223 --> 00:54:03,891
I'm going back to the
observation car for a smoke.

1027
00:54:03,975 --> 00:54:05,685
Right this way, sir.

1028
00:54:37,509 --> 00:54:38,969
Like a chair?

1029
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:44,099
No, thanks. I'd rather stand.

1030
00:54:45,517 --> 00:54:48,896
You going far? Palo Alto.

1031
00:54:49,772 --> 00:54:50,856
My name's Jackson.

1032
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:54,109
I'm going all the way
to Medford. Medford, Oregon.

1033
00:54:54,527 --> 00:54:56,529
I had a broken arm once.

1034
00:54:57,029 --> 00:55:00,324
That darn cast itches
something fierce, doesn't it?

1035
00:55:00,449 --> 00:55:02,743
I thought I'd go crazy
with mine.

1036
00:55:02,785 --> 00:55:06,873
Palo Alto's a nice little
town. You a Stanford man?

1037
00:55:07,665 --> 00:55:11,878
I used to be. I'll bet
you left something behind.

1038
00:55:12,629 --> 00:55:14,047
I always do.

1039
00:55:14,213 --> 00:55:15,951
My cigar case. I
guess I left it in

1040
00:55:15,976 --> 00:55:17,592
my overcoat back in the section.

1041
00:55:17,634 --> 00:55:20,970
Would you care to roll
yourself a cigarette, Mister...

1042
00:55:21,054 --> 00:55:22,055
Dietrichson.

1043
00:55:22,555 --> 00:55:25,058
No thanks,
I really prefer a cigar.

1044
00:55:25,767 --> 00:55:28,937
Maybe the porter could... Well,
I could get your cigars for you.

1045
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:32,399
Be glad to, Mr. Dietrichson.
If it's not too much trouble.

1046
00:55:32,482 --> 00:55:36,278
Car 9, section 11. Car 9,
section 11. With pleasure.

1047
00:56:20,532 --> 00:56:22,117
Okay. This has gotta be fast.

1048
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,662
Here, take his hat. Pick up
the crutches back on the tracks.

1049
00:56:54,942 --> 00:56:56,819
Okay, baby. That's it.

1050
00:57:55,129 --> 00:57:56,923
All right. Let's go.

1051
00:58:06,808 --> 00:58:08,601
<i>On the way back,
we went over once more...</i>

1052
00:58:08,685 --> 00:58:10,103
<i>what she was to do
at the inquest...</i>

1053
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:13,940
<i>if they had one, and about the
insurance, when that came up.</i>

1054
00:58:14,065 --> 00:58:15,584
<i>I was afraid she
might go to pieces</i>

1055
00:58:15,609 --> 00:58:17,110
<i>a little, now that
we had done it.</i>

1056
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:19,524
<i>But she was perfect.
No nerves. Not a</i>

1057
00:58:19,549 --> 00:58:21,781
<i>tear, not even a
blink of the eyes.</i>

1058
00:58:22,824 --> 00:58:25,869
<i>She dropped me a block
from my apartment house.</i>

1059
00:58:26,661 --> 00:58:30,123
Walter, what's the matter?
Aren't you going to kiss me?

1060
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:37,673
It's straight down the line,
isn't it?

1061
00:58:42,428 --> 00:58:45,890
I love you, Walter.
I love you, baby.

1062
00:58:59,028 --> 00:59:00,955
<i>It was two minutes
past 11:00, as I</i>

1063
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,824
<i>went up the service
stairs again.</i>

1064
00:59:02,865 --> 00:59:04,842
<i>Nobody saw me this time either.
In</i>

1065
00:59:04,867 --> 00:59:06,869
<i>the apartment I
checked the bells.</i>

1066
00:59:06,953 --> 00:59:09,956
<i>The cards hadn't moved.
No calls. No visitors.</i>

1067
00:59:11,458 --> 00:59:15,420
<i>Then I changed my clothes again.
That left one last thing to do.</i>

1068
00:59:16,379 --> 00:59:18,356
<i>I had to go down to the garage. I</i>

1069
00:59:18,381 --> 00:59:20,383
<i>wanted Charlie to see me again.</i>

1070
00:59:27,057 --> 00:59:29,977
You gonna use your car, after
all? I'm not quite through.

1071
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:31,895
Well, that's all right, Charlie.

1072
00:59:31,979 --> 00:59:34,139
Just going up to the drugstore
to get something to eat.

1073
00:59:34,148 --> 00:59:35,544
Been working upstairs all night.
My

1074
00:59:35,569 --> 00:59:37,109
stomach's getting a
little sore at me.

1075
00:59:37,192 --> 00:59:38,777
Yes, sir, Mr. Neff.

1076
00:59:40,738 --> 00:59:42,698
<i>That was all there was to it.</i>

1077
00:59:42,781 --> 00:59:45,451
<i>Nothing had slipped,
nothing had been overlooked.</i>

1078
00:59:45,534 --> 00:59:47,912
<i>There was nothing
to give us away.</i>

1079
00:59:47,995 --> 00:59:49,653
<i>And yet, Keyes, as I was walking</i>

1080
00:59:49,678 --> 00:59:51,624
<i>down the street to
the drugstore...</i>

1081
00:59:51,707 --> 00:59:55,127
<i>suddenly it came over me that
everything would go wrong.</i>

1082
00:59:55,211 --> 00:59:58,381
<i>It sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it's true, so help me.</i>

1083
00:59:58,589 --> 01:00:00,967
<i>I couldn't hear
my own footsteps.</i>

1084
01:00:04,137 --> 01:00:06,389
<i>It was the walk of a dead man.</i>

1085
01:00:14,272 --> 01:00:16,858
That was the longest night
I ever lived through, Keyes...

1086
01:00:16,942 --> 01:00:18,945
and the next day was
worse, when the

1087
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:20,779
story had broke in the papers...

1088
01:00:20,862 --> 01:00:22,822
and they started talking
about it at the office...

1089
01:00:22,823 --> 01:00:26,076
and the day after that, when
you started digging into it.

1090
01:00:26,118 --> 01:00:28,340
I kept my hands in
my pockets because

1091
01:00:28,365 --> 01:00:30,080
I thought they were shaking.

1092
01:00:30,122 --> 01:00:32,374
I put on dark glasses so
people couldn't see my eyes.

1093
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:34,297
And then I took them
off again so they

1094
01:00:34,322 --> 01:00:36,378
wouldn't get to wondering
why I wore them.

1095
01:00:36,462 --> 01:00:39,173
I tried to
hold myself together, but...

1096
01:00:39,506 --> 01:00:42,510
<i>I could feel my nerves
pulling me to pieces.</i>

1097
01:00:45,262 --> 01:00:48,099
Walter? Hello, Keyes.

1098
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:50,518
Come along. The big boss
wants to see us.

1099
01:00:50,601 --> 01:00:52,895
The Dietrichson case? Must be.

1100
01:00:53,062 --> 01:00:55,022
Anything wrong?
Well, the guy is dead.

1101
01:00:55,106 --> 01:00:57,796
We had him insured and
it's gonna cost us dough.

1102
01:00:57,821 --> 01:00:58,985
That's always wrong.

1103
01:00:59,068 --> 01:01:01,321
What have they got so far?
Autopsy report.

1104
01:01:01,404 --> 01:01:03,046
No heart failure,
no apoplexy, no

1105
01:01:03,071 --> 01:01:05,033
predisposing medical
cause of any kind.

1106
01:01:05,116 --> 01:01:06,951
Died of a broken neck.

1107
01:01:07,118 --> 01:01:09,120
When's the inquest?
Had it this morning.

1108
01:01:09,204 --> 01:01:11,289
His wife and daughter
made the identification.

1109
01:01:11,331 --> 01:01:12,548
The train people and some of the

1110
01:01:12,573 --> 01:01:14,125
passengers told how
he went through...

1111
01:01:14,209 --> 01:01:15,460
to the observation car.

1112
01:01:15,544 --> 01:01:19,131
It was all over in 45 minutes.
Verdict? Accidental death.

1113
01:01:20,716 --> 01:01:22,175
What do the police figure?

1114
01:01:22,259 --> 01:01:24,928
That he got tangled up in his
crutches and fell off the train.

1115
01:01:25,012 --> 01:01:26,638
They're satisfied.

1116
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:29,308
It's not their dough.
Come on, Walter.

1117
01:01:30,809 --> 01:01:32,644
All right. Thank
you very much, gentlemen.

1118
01:01:32,811 --> 01:01:34,980
I believe the legal position
is now clear.

1119
01:01:35,022 --> 01:01:37,358
Please stand by.
I may need you later.

1120
01:01:37,441 --> 01:01:40,319
Come in, Mr. Keyes.
You, too, Mr. Neff.

1121
01:01:44,657 --> 01:01:46,951
You find this an uncomfortably
warm day, Mr. Keyes?

1122
01:01:47,034 --> 01:01:49,996
I'm sorry, Mr. Norton, but I
didn't know this was formal.

1123
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:51,455
Sit down, gentlemen. Thank you.

1124
01:01:51,539 --> 01:01:52,540
Any new developments?

1125
01:01:52,623 --> 01:01:53,951
I just talked to
this Jackson long

1126
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:55,256
distance, up in Medford, Oregon.

1127
01:01:55,334 --> 01:01:56,335
Who's Jackson?

1128
01:01:56,419 --> 01:01:57,962
He's the last man who saw
Dietrichson alive.

1129
01:01:58,046 --> 01:02:00,590
They were out on the observation
platform together, talking.

1130
01:02:00,673 --> 01:02:02,793
Dietrichson wanted a cigar
and so Jackson went back...

1131
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,469
to get Dietrichson's
cigar case for him.

1132
01:02:04,552 --> 01:02:06,952
When he returned to the observation
platform, no Dietrichson.

1133
01:02:06,971 --> 01:02:08,848
Well, Jackson didn't think
anything was wrong until...

1134
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:10,892
a wire caught up with
the train at Santa Barbara.

1135
01:02:10,934 --> 01:02:13,687
They found Dietrichson's body
on the tracks near Burbank.

1136
01:02:13,728 --> 01:02:16,231
Very interesting about
the cigar case.

1137
01:02:16,314 --> 01:02:18,316
Anything else? No, not much.

1138
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,691
Dietrichson's secretary says she

1139
01:02:19,716 --> 01:02:21,361
didn't know anything
about the policy.

1140
01:02:21,445 --> 01:02:23,312
There's a daughter,
but all she remembers

1141
01:02:23,337 --> 01:02:24,823
is Neff talking to her father...

1142
01:02:24,907 --> 01:02:27,117
about accident insurance
at their house one night.

1143
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,535
I couldn't sell him at first.

1144
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:31,580
Mr. Dietrichson opposed it.
He said he'd think it over.

1145
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:34,833
Later I saw him in the
oil fields and closed him.

1146
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,919
He signed the application
and gave me his check.

1147
01:02:37,002 --> 01:02:39,380
A fine piece of salesmanship
that was, Mr. Neff.

1148
01:02:39,463 --> 01:02:41,090
Well, there's no sense in
pushing Neff around.

1149
01:02:41,173 --> 01:02:43,134
He's got the best
sales record in the office.

1150
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:44,735
Are your salesmen
supposed to know a

1151
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,470
customer is going to
fall off the train?

1152
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:50,349
Fall off a train? Are we sure
Dietrichson fell off the train?

1153
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,019
I don't get it.
You don't, Mr. Keyes?

1154
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,562
Then what do you
think of this case?

1155
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,397
This policy might cost us
a great deal of money.

1156
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:58,608
As you know, it contains
a double indemnity clause.

1157
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:00,443
Just what is your opinion?

1158
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:02,237
No opinion at all.
Not even a hunch?

1159
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,697
One of those interesting
little hunches of yours?

1160
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,074
Nope. Not even a hunch.

1161
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:09,869
I'm surprised, Mr. Keyes. I've
formed a very definite opinion.

1162
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:11,716
I think I know.
In fact, I know I

1163
01:03:11,741 --> 01:03:13,582
know what happened
to Dietrichson.

1164
01:03:13,665 --> 01:03:17,044
You know you know what?
I know it was not an accident.

1165
01:03:20,422 --> 01:03:22,966
What do you say to that? Me?

1166
01:03:24,343 --> 01:03:26,762
Well, you've got the ball.
Let's see you run with it.

1167
01:03:26,804 --> 01:03:28,644
There's a widespread
feeling that just

1168
01:03:28,669 --> 01:03:30,391
because a man has
a large office...

1169
01:03:33,477 --> 01:03:36,146
Yes? Have her come in, please.

1170
01:03:36,689 --> 01:03:38,232
There's a widespread
feeling that...

1171
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:41,610
just because a man has a large
office, he must be an idiot.

1172
01:03:41,694 --> 01:03:43,654
I'm having a visitor,
if you don't mind.

1173
01:03:43,696 --> 01:03:46,657
No, no. I want you to stay
and watch me handle this.

1174
01:03:46,741 --> 01:03:48,367
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1175
01:03:52,538 --> 01:03:54,958
Thank you very much
for coming, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1176
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:57,794
I assure you I appreciate
it. This is Mr. Keyes.

1177
01:03:57,877 --> 01:03:59,337
How do you do? How do you do?

1178
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:01,423
And Mr. Neff. I've met
Mr. Neff. How do you do?

1179
01:04:01,506 --> 01:04:04,092
Mrs. Dietrichson.
Won't you sit down?

1180
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,555
May I extend our
sympathy in your bereavement?

1181
01:04:08,638 --> 01:04:09,771
I hesitated before asking you to

1182
01:04:09,796 --> 01:04:11,116
come here so soon
after your loss.

1183
01:04:11,183 --> 01:04:13,015
But now that you're
here I hope you won't

1184
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:14,853
mind if I plunge
straight into business?

1185
01:04:14,936 --> 01:04:16,480
You know why we asked
you to come, don't you?

1186
01:04:16,563 --> 01:04:19,149
No. All I know is that your
secretary made it sound very urgent.

1187
01:04:19,232 --> 01:04:21,360
Your husband had an accident
policy with this company.

1188
01:04:21,443 --> 01:04:23,153
Evidently you don't know that,
Mrs. Dietrichson.

1189
01:04:23,195 --> 01:04:24,389
No. I remember some talk at the

1190
01:04:24,414 --> 01:04:25,948
house, but he didn't
seem to want it.

1191
01:04:26,031 --> 01:04:27,677
Your husband took
the policy out a

1192
01:04:27,702 --> 01:04:29,326
few days later, Mrs.
Dietrichson.

1193
01:04:29,368 --> 01:04:31,870
You'll probably find the policy
among his personal effects.

1194
01:04:31,954 --> 01:04:33,706
His safe-deposit box
hasn't been opened yet.

1195
01:04:33,789 --> 01:04:35,791
It seems a tax examiner
has to be present.

1196
01:04:35,875 --> 01:04:37,543
Please, Mrs. Dietrichson,
I don't want you to think...

1197
01:04:37,626 --> 01:04:39,045
you're being subjected to
any questioning...

1198
01:04:39,128 --> 01:04:40,755
but there are a few things
we should like to know.

1199
01:04:40,838 --> 01:04:41,839
What sort of things?

1200
01:04:42,256 --> 01:04:44,425
We have the report of
the coroner's inquest.

1201
01:04:44,508 --> 01:04:47,553
Accidental death.
We are not entirely satisfied.

1202
01:04:47,637 --> 01:04:50,223
In fact,
we are not satisfied at all.

1203
01:04:52,183 --> 01:04:54,811
Frankly, Mrs. Dietrichson,
we suspect...

1204
01:04:56,062 --> 01:04:57,355
a suicide.

1205
01:05:00,775 --> 01:05:04,154
I'm sorry. Would you like
a glass of water? Please.

1206
01:05:08,909 --> 01:05:10,243
Thank you.

1207
01:05:16,249 --> 01:05:18,076
Had your husband
been depressed or

1208
01:05:18,101 --> 01:05:19,795
moody lately, Mrs. Dietrichson?

1209
01:05:19,878 --> 01:05:22,631
Did he have financial worries,
for instance?

1210
01:05:22,714 --> 01:05:24,214
He was perfectly all right and I

1211
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:26,051
don't know of any
financial worries.

1212
01:05:26,093 --> 01:05:28,220
Let us examine this
so-called accident.

1213
01:05:28,304 --> 01:05:30,404
First, your husband
takes out this

1214
01:05:30,429 --> 01:05:32,433
policy in absolute secrecy. Why?

1215
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:34,056
Because he doesn't
want his family

1216
01:05:34,081 --> 01:05:35,519
to suspect what
he intends to do.

1217
01:05:35,603 --> 01:05:38,230
Do what? Next, he goes on
this trip entirely alone.

1218
01:05:38,314 --> 01:05:40,130
He has to be alone.
He hobbles all the

1219
01:05:40,155 --> 01:05:41,901
way out to the
observation platform.

1220
01:05:41,984 --> 01:05:43,844
Very unlikely with
his leg in a cast,

1221
01:05:43,869 --> 01:05:45,655
unless he has a
very strong reason.

1222
01:05:45,905 --> 01:05:48,991
Once there, he finds he is not
alone. There is a man there.

1223
01:05:49,075 --> 01:05:51,709
What was his name, Keyes?
His name was Jackson.

1224
01:05:51,734 --> 01:05:52,787
Probably still is.

1225
01:05:53,288 --> 01:05:55,200
So he gets rid of
this Jackson with

1226
01:05:55,225 --> 01:05:57,000
some flimsy excuse about cigars.

1227
01:05:57,083 --> 01:06:00,378
And then he is alone. And
then he does it. Does what?

1228
01:06:00,462 --> 01:06:04,132
He jumps. Suicide. In which
case, the company is not liable.

1229
01:06:04,507 --> 01:06:07,385
You know that, of course.
Now, we could go to court...

1230
01:06:07,469 --> 01:06:11,264
I don't know anything. In fact,
I don't know why I came here.

1231
01:06:11,473 --> 01:06:13,673
Just a moment, please. I
said we could go to court.

1232
01:06:13,698 --> 01:06:14,768
I didn't say we want to.

1233
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:17,729
What I want to suggest is
a compromise on both sides.

1234
01:06:17,813 --> 01:06:20,274
A settlement for a certain
sum, a part of the policy value.

1235
01:06:20,315 --> 01:06:22,102
Don't bother, Mr. Norton.
When I came in

1236
01:06:22,127 --> 01:06:24,028
here, I had no idea you
owed me any money.

1237
01:06:24,111 --> 01:06:26,113
You told me you did.
Then you told me you didn't.

1238
01:06:26,196 --> 01:06:28,616
Now you tell me you want to pay
me a part of it, whatever it is.

1239
01:06:28,699 --> 01:06:31,035
You want to bargain with me,
at a time like this.

1240
01:06:31,118 --> 01:06:32,762
I don't like your
insinuations about my

1241
01:06:32,787 --> 01:06:34,455
husband, and I don't
like your methods.

1242
01:06:34,538 --> 01:06:38,292
In fact, I don't like you,
Mr. Norton. Goodbye, gentlemen.

1243
01:06:43,089 --> 01:06:46,342
Nice going, Mr. Norton.
You sure carried that ball.

1244
01:06:46,426 --> 01:06:47,802
Only you fumbled
on the goal line.

1245
01:06:47,844 --> 01:06:49,532
Then you heaved an
illegal forward pass

1246
01:06:49,557 --> 01:06:51,055
and got thrown for
a 40-yard loss.

1247
01:06:51,139 --> 01:06:52,652
Now you can't pick
yourself up because

1248
01:06:52,677 --> 01:06:54,058
you haven't got a
leg to stand on.

1249
01:06:54,142 --> 01:06:55,663
I haven't? She can go to court

1250
01:06:55,688 --> 01:06:57,145
and we can prove it was suicide.

1251
01:06:57,228 --> 01:06:58,730
Can we?

1252
01:06:58,813 --> 01:07:00,621
Mr. Norton, the first thing that

1253
01:07:00,646 --> 01:07:02,651
struck me was that
suicide angle.

1254
01:07:02,692 --> 01:07:04,651
Only I dumped it
into the wastepaper

1255
01:07:04,676 --> 01:07:06,446
basket just three seconds later.

1256
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:08,325
You know, you ought
to take a look at

1257
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:10,075
the statistics on
suicide sometime.

1258
01:07:10,158 --> 01:07:12,678
You might learn a little something
about the insurance business.

1259
01:07:12,703 --> 01:07:14,830
Mr. Keyes, I was raised
in the insurance business.

1260
01:07:14,872 --> 01:07:16,665
Yeah, in the front office.

1261
01:07:16,707 --> 01:07:18,513
Come now, you've never
read an actuarial

1262
01:07:18,538 --> 01:07:19,877
table in your life, have you?

1263
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,212
Why, they've got 10 volumes
on suicide alone.

1264
01:07:22,296 --> 01:07:24,089
Suicide by race, by color,
by occupation...

1265
01:07:24,173 --> 01:07:26,133
by sex, by seasons of
the year, by time of day.

1266
01:07:26,217 --> 01:07:27,881
Suicide, how committed?
By poisons,

1267
01:07:27,906 --> 01:07:29,595
by firearms, by
drowning, by leaps.

1268
01:07:29,678 --> 01:07:32,348
Suicide by poison, subdivided
by types of poison...

1269
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:35,017
such as corrosive, irritant,
systemic, gaseous, narcotic...

1270
01:07:35,101 --> 01:07:36,560
alkaloid, protein, and so forth.

1271
01:07:36,644 --> 01:07:39,355
Suicide by leaps, subdivided
by leaps from high places...

1272
01:07:39,397 --> 01:07:41,524
under the wheels of trains,
under the wheels of trucks...

1273
01:07:41,607 --> 01:07:44,861
under the feet of horses, from
steamboats. But, Mr. Norton...

1274
01:07:45,111 --> 01:07:46,882
of all the cases on
record there's not

1275
01:07:46,907 --> 01:07:48,656
one single case of
suicide by leap...

1276
01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:50,140
from the rear end
of a moving train.

1277
01:07:50,158 --> 01:07:51,910
And do you know how fast
that train was going...

1278
01:07:51,993 --> 01:07:54,954
at the point where the body
was found? 15 miles an hour.

1279
01:07:55,038 --> 01:07:57,207
Now how can anybody jump off
a slow moving train like that...

1280
01:07:57,248 --> 01:08:00,126
with any kind of expectation
that he would kill himself?

1281
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,878
No. No soap, Mr. Norton.

1282
01:08:01,962 --> 01:08:03,458
We're sunk, and
we'll have to pay

1283
01:08:03,483 --> 01:08:05,048
through the nose,
and you know it.

1284
01:08:05,132 --> 01:08:06,717
May I have this?

1285
01:08:10,095 --> 01:08:11,680
Come on, Walter.

1286
01:08:14,808 --> 01:08:17,019
Next time I'll rent a tuxedo.

1287
01:08:33,452 --> 01:08:35,913
<i>I could have hugged you
right then and there, Keyes...</i>

1288
01:08:35,955 --> 01:08:37,540
<i>you and your statistics.</i>

1289
01:08:37,623 --> 01:08:40,334
<i>You were the only one
we were really scared of...</i>

1290
01:08:40,418 --> 01:08:43,129
<i>and instead you were
almost playing on our team.</i>

1291
01:08:43,338 --> 01:08:46,382
<i>That evening when I got home,
my nerves had eased off.</i>

1292
01:08:46,466 --> 01:08:48,468
<i>I could feel the ground
under my feet again.</i>

1293
01:08:48,551 --> 01:08:51,346
<i>And it looked like easy going
from there on in.</i>

1294
01:08:51,429 --> 01:08:53,681
<i>That $100,000 looked
as safe for Phyllis and me...</i>

1295
01:08:53,765 --> 01:08:56,434
<i>as if we had the check
already deposited in the bank.</i>

1296
01:09:02,816 --> 01:09:07,237
Hello? Hello, baby.
Sure, everything is fine.

1297
01:09:08,071 --> 01:09:09,615
You were wonderful
in Norton's office.

1298
01:09:09,698 --> 01:09:12,951
I felt so funny, I wanted to
look at you all the time.

1299
01:09:12,993 --> 01:09:15,537
How do you think I felt, baby?
Where are you?

1300
01:09:15,621 --> 01:09:18,207
At the drugstore.
Just a block away.

1301
01:09:18,457 --> 01:09:20,542
Can I come up?
Okay. But be careful.

1302
01:09:20,626 --> 01:09:22,378
Don't let anybody see you.

1303
01:09:48,696 --> 01:09:50,156
Hello, Keyes.

1304
01:09:55,829 --> 01:09:58,456
What's on your mind?
That broken leg.

1305
01:09:58,999 --> 01:10:02,085
The guy had a broken leg.
What are you talking about?

1306
01:10:02,169 --> 01:10:05,672
Talking about Dietrichson. He
had accident insurance, didn't he?

1307
01:10:05,964 --> 01:10:08,008
Yeah. Then he broke his leg, didn't he?

1308
01:10:08,091 --> 01:10:10,052
So what?
And he didn't put in a claim.

1309
01:10:10,093 --> 01:10:13,847
Why didn't he put in a claim?
Why? What are you driving at?

1310
01:10:14,056 --> 01:10:18,852
Walter, I had dinner two hours
ago and it stuck half way.

1311
01:10:18,894 --> 01:10:20,614
That little man of yours
is acting up again?

1312
01:10:20,688 --> 01:10:23,023
There's something wrong
with the Dietrichson case.

1313
01:10:23,065 --> 01:10:25,098
Why? Because he
didn't file a claim?

1314
01:10:25,123 --> 01:10:26,902
Maybe he just didn't have time.

1315
01:10:26,986 --> 01:10:29,989
Maybe he just didn't know that
he was insured.

1316
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:33,659
No. No, that couldn't be it.

1317
01:10:33,743 --> 01:10:35,912
You delivered the policy
to him personally, didn't you?

1318
01:10:35,995 --> 01:10:36,996
Yeah. You got his check?

1319
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:38,247
Sure I did.

1320
01:10:39,082 --> 01:10:42,001
Got any bicarbonate of soda?
No, I haven't.

1321
01:10:42,752 --> 01:10:46,381
Walter, I've been living with
this little man for 26 years.

1322
01:10:46,923 --> 01:10:49,551
And he's never failed me yet.
There's got to be something wrong.

1323
01:10:49,634 --> 01:10:52,053
Well, maybe Norton was right.
Maybe it was suicide.

1324
01:10:52,137 --> 01:10:53,722
No. Not suicide.

1325
01:10:54,347 --> 01:10:57,392
But not an accident, either.
What else?

1326
01:10:57,934 --> 01:10:59,186
Now look, Walter.

1327
01:10:59,269 --> 01:11:02,230
A guy takes out an accident
policy that's worth $100,000...

1328
01:11:02,272 --> 01:11:03,357
if he's killed on a train.

1329
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,317
Then two weeks later,
he is killed on a train.

1330
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:07,428
And not in a train
accident, mind you, but

1331
01:11:07,453 --> 01:11:09,363
falling off some silly
observation car.

1332
01:11:09,446 --> 01:11:12,116
Do you know what the mathematical
probability of that is?

1333
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:15,077
One out of I don't know
how many billions.

1334
01:11:15,869 --> 01:11:18,213
And add to that the broken leg.
No,

1335
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:20,541
it just can't be
the way it looks.

1336
01:11:21,083 --> 01:11:25,087
Something has been worked
on us. Such as what?

1337
01:11:33,137 --> 01:11:34,305
Murder?

1338
01:11:34,806 --> 01:11:36,682
Don't you have any peppermint
or something?

1339
01:11:36,766 --> 01:11:39,560
Sorry. Want a little
soda water? No, no, no.

1340
01:11:40,937 --> 01:11:41,937
Who do you suspect?

1341
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,940
Maybe I like to
make things easy for myself.

1342
01:11:43,982 --> 01:11:46,025
But I always tend to suspect
the beneficiary.

1343
01:11:46,109 --> 01:11:47,193
You mean the wife? Yeah.

1344
01:11:47,277 --> 01:11:48,677
That wide-eyed dame
that just didn't

1345
01:11:48,682 --> 01:11:49,842
know anything about anything.

1346
01:11:49,904 --> 01:11:51,906
You're crazy, Keyes.
She wasn't even on the train.

1347
01:11:51,990 --> 01:11:53,283
I know she wasn't, Walter.

1348
01:11:53,325 --> 01:11:55,577
I don't claim to know how it
was worked, or who worked it...

1349
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:58,080
but all I know is that
it was worked.

1350
01:11:58,163 --> 01:11:59,873
I've got to get to a drugstore.

1351
01:11:59,956 --> 01:12:02,918
This thing feels like
a hunk of concrete inside me.

1352
01:12:03,001 --> 01:12:05,671
Good night, Walter.
Good night, Keyes.

1353
01:12:06,004 --> 01:12:08,966
See you at the office
in the morning. Yeah.

1354
01:12:10,008 --> 01:12:12,594
I'd like to move in on her
right now, tonight.

1355
01:12:12,678 --> 01:12:14,337
If it wasn't for Norton and his

1356
01:12:14,362 --> 01:12:16,807
striped-pants ideas
about company policy...

1357
01:12:16,891 --> 01:12:19,560
I'd have the police after her
so fast it'd make her head spin.

1358
01:12:19,643 --> 01:12:21,187
They'd put her
through the wringer...

1359
01:12:21,270 --> 01:12:24,106
and, brother, the things
they would squeeze out.

1360
01:12:24,190 --> 01:12:26,230
Only you haven't got a
single thing to go on, Keyes.

1361
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:28,569
Not too much.
Just 26 years experience...

1362
01:12:28,653 --> 01:12:30,553
all the percentage there is, and

1363
01:12:30,578 --> 01:12:32,865
this hunk of concrete
in my stomach.

1364
01:12:35,034 --> 01:12:37,328
Can I have one of those things?

1365
01:12:48,173 --> 01:12:50,634
Good night, Keyes.
So long, Walter.

1366
01:13:04,064 --> 01:13:07,276
How much does he know?
He doesn't know anything.

1367
01:13:07,901 --> 01:13:10,070
It's those stinking
hunches of his.

1368
01:13:10,154 --> 01:13:11,554
And he can't prove anything,
can he?

1369
01:13:11,572 --> 01:13:13,408
Not if we're careful. Not if we

1370
01:13:13,433 --> 01:13:15,534
don't see each
other for a while.

1371
01:13:17,578 --> 01:13:20,122
How long a while?
Until this dies down.

1372
01:13:20,206 --> 01:13:21,206
You don't know Keyes.

1373
01:13:21,248 --> 01:13:23,334
Once he gets his teeth into
something, he never lets go.

1374
01:13:23,417 --> 01:13:25,086
He'll investigate you,
have you shadowed.

1375
01:13:25,169 --> 01:13:27,964
He'll watch you
every minute from now on.

1376
01:13:28,047 --> 01:13:30,508
You afraid, baby?
Yes, I'm afraid.

1377
01:13:31,634 --> 01:13:35,596
But not of Keyes. I'm afraid of
us. We're not the same anymore.

1378
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,240
We did it so we could
be together, but

1379
01:13:37,265 --> 01:13:38,850
instead of that it's
pulling us apart.

1380
01:13:38,933 --> 01:13:40,693
Isn't it, Walter?
What are you talking about?

1381
01:13:40,768 --> 01:13:44,439
And you don't really care
whether we see each other or not.

1382
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:47,400
Shut up, baby.

1383
01:13:51,655 --> 01:13:54,074
<i>Pacific All
Risk. Good afternoon.</i>

1384
01:13:56,368 --> 01:13:57,953
Hello, Mr. Neff.

1385
01:13:58,954 --> 01:14:00,998
Hello. Lola Dietrichson.

1386
01:14:01,373 --> 01:14:04,293
Don't you remember me?
Yes. Yes, of course.

1387
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:06,628
Could I talk with you
just a few minutes?

1388
01:14:06,712 --> 01:14:09,131
Somewhere where
we could be alone?

1389
01:14:09,381 --> 01:14:11,592
Yes. Come into my office.

1390
01:14:17,932 --> 01:14:20,101
Is it something about
what happened?

1391
01:14:20,142 --> 01:14:23,771
Yes, Mr. Neff.
It's about my father's death.

1392
01:14:24,814 --> 01:14:26,399
I'm terribly sorry,
Miss Dietrichson.

1393
01:14:30,153 --> 01:14:32,780
Lou, do you mind if I use the
office alone for a few minutes?

1394
01:14:32,822 --> 01:14:34,741
No. It's all yours, Walter.

1395
01:14:41,706 --> 01:14:43,249
Look at me, Mr. Neff.

1396
01:14:43,333 --> 01:14:46,795
I'm not crazy. I'm not
hysterical. I'm not even crying.

1397
01:14:47,879 --> 01:14:51,341
But I have the awful feeling
that something is wrong...

1398
01:14:51,675 --> 01:14:55,470
and I had that same feeling
once before, when my mother died.

1399
01:14:55,512 --> 01:14:56,555
When your mother died?

1400
01:14:56,638 --> 01:14:59,016
We were at Lake Arrowhead.
That was six years ago.

1401
01:14:59,099 --> 01:15:00,100
We had a cabin there.

1402
01:15:00,184 --> 01:15:02,089
It was winter and very cold. My

1403
01:15:02,114 --> 01:15:04,480
mother was very sick
with pneumonia.

1404
01:15:04,813 --> 01:15:06,523
She had a nurse with her.

1405
01:15:06,648 --> 01:15:09,610
There were just
the three of us in the cabin.

1406
01:15:09,735 --> 01:15:12,446
One night I got up and
went into my mother's room.

1407
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:14,365
She was delirious with fever.

1408
01:15:14,448 --> 01:15:16,413
All the bed covers
were on the floor

1409
01:15:16,438 --> 01:15:18,160
and the windows were wide open.

1410
01:15:18,244 --> 01:15:19,412
The nurse wasn't in the room.

1411
01:15:19,495 --> 01:15:21,664
I ran and covered my mother up
as quickly as I could.

1412
01:15:21,747 --> 01:15:24,500
Just then I heard
a door open behind me.

1413
01:15:25,126 --> 01:15:27,003
The nurse stood there.

1414
01:15:27,545 --> 01:15:31,174
She didn't say a word, but
there was a look in her eyes...

1415
01:15:31,341 --> 01:15:33,009
I'll never forget.

1416
01:15:35,053 --> 01:15:38,181
Two days later,
my mother was dead.

1417
01:15:41,476 --> 01:15:43,812
Do you know who that nurse was?

1418
01:15:44,020 --> 01:15:45,689
No. Who? Phyllis.

1419
01:15:46,147 --> 01:15:48,525
I tried to tell my father,
but I was just a kid then.

1420
01:15:48,567 --> 01:15:51,737
He wouldn't listen to me. Six
months later she married him...

1421
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:54,089
and I kind of talked
myself out of the idea

1422
01:15:54,114 --> 01:15:56,199
she could have done
anything like that.

1423
01:15:56,283 --> 01:15:58,432
But now it's all
back again, now that

1424
01:15:58,457 --> 01:16:00,746
something's happened
to my father, too.

1425
01:16:00,829 --> 01:16:03,065
You're not making sense,
Miss Dietrichson.

1426
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:04,667
Your father fell off a train.

1427
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:06,247
Yes, and two days
before he fell off

1428
01:16:06,272 --> 01:16:07,753
that train, what
was Phyllis doing?

1429
01:16:07,836 --> 01:16:10,356
She was in her room in front of
a mirror, with a black hat on...

1430
01:16:10,422 --> 01:16:11,715
pinning a black veil to it.

1431
01:16:11,799 --> 01:16:15,219
As if she couldn't wait to see
how she would look in mourning.

1432
01:16:15,302 --> 01:16:17,346
You've had a pretty bad shock,
Miss Dietrichson.

1433
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:19,056
Aren't you just
imagining these things?

1434
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:20,558
I caught her eyes in the mirror.

1435
01:16:20,641 --> 01:16:23,686
They had that look in them
they had before my mother died.

1436
01:16:23,769 --> 01:16:25,229
That same look.

1437
01:16:25,938 --> 01:16:27,732
You don't like
your stepmother, do you?

1438
01:16:27,774 --> 01:16:29,609
Isn't it just because
she is your stepmother?

1439
01:16:29,692 --> 01:16:32,111
I loathe her because she did
it. She did it for the money.

1440
01:16:32,195 --> 01:16:34,531
Only you're not going to
pay her, are you, Mr. Neff?

1441
01:16:34,614 --> 01:16:36,233
She's not going to get
away with it this

1442
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,742
time, because I'm
going to speak up.

1443
01:16:37,784 --> 01:16:39,285
I'm going to
tell everything I know.

1444
01:16:39,369 --> 01:16:42,062
You'd better be careful,
saying things like...

1445
01:16:42,087 --> 01:16:43,707
I'm not afraid. You'll see.

1446
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:53,342
I'm sorry.

1447
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:59,014
I didn't mean to act like this.

1448
01:17:00,307 --> 01:17:03,352
All this that you've been telling
me, who else have you told?

1449
01:17:03,435 --> 01:17:04,603
No one.

1450
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:07,231
How about your stepmother?
Of course not.

1451
01:17:08,232 --> 01:17:09,733
I've moved out.

1452
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:12,987
I'm not living at home anymore.

1453
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:15,614
And you haven't told that
boyfriend of yours? Zachetti?

1454
01:17:15,698 --> 01:17:18,618
I'm not seeing him anymore.
We had a fight.

1455
01:17:20,203 --> 01:17:22,038
Where are you living now?

1456
01:17:22,121 --> 01:17:25,083
I got myself a little
apartment in Hollywood.

1457
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:28,336
Four walls, and you just
sit and look at them?

1458
01:17:29,212 --> 01:17:30,713
Yes, Mr. Neff.

1459
01:17:33,550 --> 01:17:35,093
<i>So that evening
I took her to dinner...</i>

1460
01:17:35,176 --> 01:17:37,090
<i>at a Mexican restaurant
down on Olvera.</i>

1461
01:17:37,115 --> 01:17:38,805
<i>Street where nobody
would see us.</i>

1462
01:17:38,888 --> 01:17:40,890
<i>I wanted to cheer her up.</i>

1463
01:17:41,308 --> 01:17:42,838
<i>The next day was Sunday and we</i>

1464
01:17:42,863 --> 01:17:44,728
<i>went for a ride
down to the beach.</i>

1465
01:17:44,811 --> 01:17:47,522
<i>She had loosened up a bit,
she was even laughing.</i>

1466
01:17:47,606 --> 01:17:49,354
<i>I had to make sure
that she wouldn't tell</i>

1467
01:17:49,379 --> 01:17:51,151
<i>that stuff about Phyllis
to anybody else.</i>

1468
01:17:51,234 --> 01:17:54,154
<i>It was dynamite,
whether it was true or not.</i>

1469
01:17:54,363 --> 01:17:56,198
<i>And I had no chance
to talk to Phyllis.</i>

1470
01:17:56,281 --> 01:17:58,492
<i>You were watching her
like a hawk, Keyes.</i>

1471
01:17:58,534 --> 01:18:00,648
<i>I couldn't even
phone her because I</i>

1472
01:18:00,673 --> 01:18:02,871
<i>was afraid you had
the wires tapped.</i>

1473
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,031
<i>Monday morning there
was a note on my</i>

1474
01:18:05,056 --> 01:18:07,084
<i>desk that you wanted
to see me, Keyes.</i>

1475
01:18:07,168 --> 01:18:10,129
<i>For a minute I wondered
if it could be about Lola.</i>

1476
01:18:10,212 --> 01:18:11,672
<i>It was worse.</i>

1477
01:18:12,214 --> 01:18:16,177
<i>Outside your door was the last
guy in the world I wanted to see.</i>

1478
01:18:25,353 --> 01:18:27,313
Come in. Come in, Walter.

1479
01:18:28,856 --> 01:18:31,734
Hello, Keyes.
I want to ask you something.

1480
01:18:32,193 --> 01:18:34,028
After all the years
we've known each other...

1481
01:18:34,112 --> 01:18:36,031
do you mind if I make
a rather blunt statement?

1482
01:18:36,114 --> 01:18:37,699
About what? About me.

1483
01:18:38,325 --> 01:18:40,994
Walter, I'm a very great man.
Yeah?

1484
01:18:41,077 --> 01:18:43,830
This Dietrichson business,
it's murder...

1485
01:18:43,914 --> 01:18:45,874
and murders don't come
any neater.

1486
01:18:45,957 --> 01:18:48,835
As fancy a piece of homicide
as anybody ever ran into...

1487
01:18:48,919 --> 01:18:51,171
smart, tricky,
almost perfect, but...

1488
01:18:52,089 --> 01:18:54,550
I think Papa has it
all figured out.

1489
01:18:54,591 --> 01:18:56,654
Figured out and
wrapped up in tissue

1490
01:18:56,679 --> 01:18:58,429
paper with pink ribbons on it.

1491
01:18:58,512 --> 01:19:01,223
Go ahead. I'm listening.
You know what?

1492
01:19:01,599 --> 01:19:04,560
That guy Dietrichson
was never on the train.

1493
01:19:05,728 --> 01:19:07,730
He wasn't? No, he wasn't.

1494
01:19:09,315 --> 01:19:11,609
Now look, Walter. You can't
be sure of killing a man...

1495
01:19:11,692 --> 01:19:14,820
by throwing him off a train
that's going 15 miles an hour.

1496
01:19:14,904 --> 01:19:17,365
The only way you can be sure
is to kill him first...

1497
01:19:17,448 --> 01:19:19,367
and then throw
his body on the tracks.

1498
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:21,619
Now that would mean either
killing him on the train...

1499
01:19:21,703 --> 01:19:23,509
or, and this is where
it really gets

1500
01:19:23,534 --> 01:19:25,415
fancy, you kill him
somewhere else...

1501
01:19:25,498 --> 01:19:26,708
and put him on the tracks.

1502
01:19:26,791 --> 01:19:30,044
Two possibilities, and I
personally buy the second.

1503
01:19:31,296 --> 01:19:32,797
You're way ahead of me, Keyes.

1504
01:19:32,922 --> 01:19:34,674
Well, look, Walter,
it was like this.

1505
01:19:34,966 --> 01:19:38,595
They killed the guy, the wife
and a somebody else...

1506
01:19:38,887 --> 01:19:40,551
and the somebody else
took the crutches

1507
01:19:40,576 --> 01:19:42,265
and went on the train
as Dietrichson...

1508
01:19:42,349 --> 01:19:44,101
then the somebody
else jumped off...

1509
01:19:44,184 --> 01:19:46,728
then they put the body on the
tracks where the train had passed.

1510
01:19:46,812 --> 01:19:49,481
An impersonation, see?
A cinch to work.

1511
01:19:50,315 --> 01:19:52,442
Because it was night,
very few people were about...

1512
01:19:52,484 --> 01:19:54,027
they have the crutches
to stare at...

1513
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:56,572
they never really looked
at the man at all.

1514
01:19:56,655 --> 01:19:58,782
Fancy all right, Keyes, but
maybe it's a little too fancy.

1515
01:19:58,866 --> 01:20:02,244
Is it? I tell you, it all
fits together like a watch.

1516
01:20:02,912 --> 01:20:04,789
Now let's see what we have
in the way of proof.

1517
01:20:04,872 --> 01:20:06,266
The only guy who
really got a good

1518
01:20:06,291 --> 01:20:07,792
look at this supposed
Dietrichson...

1519
01:20:07,833 --> 01:20:09,961
is sitting
right outside my office.

1520
01:20:10,044 --> 01:20:13,464
I took the trouble to bring
him down here from Oregon.

1521
01:20:15,216 --> 01:20:18,052
Come here, Mr. Jackson.
Yes, sir, Mr. Keyes.

1522
01:20:18,136 --> 01:20:19,804
These are fine cigars you smoke.

1523
01:20:19,887 --> 01:20:21,639
Two for a quarter.
That's what I said.

1524
01:20:21,681 --> 01:20:23,266
Well, did you study
those photographs?

1525
01:20:23,349 --> 01:20:25,351
Yes, indeed.
I studied them thoroughly.

1526
01:20:25,435 --> 01:20:27,270
Very thoroughly.
Have you made up your mind?

1527
01:20:27,353 --> 01:20:29,314
Mister Keyes, I'm a Medford
man. Medford, Oregon.

1528
01:20:29,397 --> 01:20:31,566
Up in Medford we take our time
making up our mind.

1529
01:20:31,649 --> 01:20:34,653
Well, we're not in Medford now.
We're in a hurry. Let's have it.

1530
01:20:34,736 --> 01:20:36,988
Are these photographs
of the late Mr. Dietrichson?

1531
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:38,031
Yes.

1532
01:20:38,573 --> 01:20:40,784
Then my answer is no.
What do you mean, no?

1533
01:20:40,867 --> 01:20:43,036
I mean, this is not
the man that was on the train.

1534
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:44,329
Will you swear to that?

1535
01:20:44,371 --> 01:20:46,373
Mr. Keyes, I'm a Medford man.
Medford, Oregon.

1536
01:20:46,456 --> 01:20:48,834
If I say it, I mean it. If I
mean it, of course I'll swear it.

1537
01:20:48,876 --> 01:20:50,516
There you are, Walter.
There's your proof.

1538
01:20:50,586 --> 01:20:52,254
This is Mr. Neff,
one of our salesmen.

1539
01:20:52,337 --> 01:20:54,298
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Neff.
Pleased, indeed.

1540
01:20:54,381 --> 01:20:55,758
How are you?
Very fine, thank you.

1541
01:20:55,841 --> 01:20:58,177
Never was better.
Sit down, Mr. Jackson.

1542
01:20:58,260 --> 01:20:59,901
Just how would you
describe the man

1543
01:20:59,926 --> 01:21:01,639
you saw on the
observation platform?

1544
01:21:01,722 --> 01:21:04,433
Well, I'm pretty sure
he was a younger man...

1545
01:21:04,558 --> 01:21:07,520
about 10 or 15 years younger
than the man in these photographs.

1546
01:21:07,561 --> 01:21:09,605
Dietrichson was about 50,
wasn't he, Walter?

1547
01:21:09,689 --> 01:21:12,066
Fifty-one,
according to the policy.

1548
01:21:12,149 --> 01:21:15,027
The man I saw was nothing like
51 years old.

1549
01:21:15,236 --> 01:21:17,739
Of course, it was pretty dark
out on that platform.

1550
01:21:17,822 --> 01:21:20,103
Come to think of it, he tried
to keep his back towards me.

1551
01:21:20,158 --> 01:21:22,785
But I'm positive just the
same. Thank you, Jackson.

1552
01:21:22,869 --> 01:21:25,349
Of course, you understand this
matter is strictly confidential?

1553
01:21:25,371 --> 01:21:26,930
We may need you again
down here in Los

1554
01:21:26,955 --> 01:21:28,458
Angeles, if the case
comes to court.

1555
01:21:28,541 --> 01:21:31,294
Any time you need me, I'm entirely
at your disposal, gentlemen.

1556
01:21:31,378 --> 01:21:34,673
Expenses paid, of course.
Yes. Yes. Of course.

1557
01:21:36,216 --> 01:21:38,885
Get me Lubin,
in the cashier's office.

1558
01:21:39,553 --> 01:21:41,596
Hello, Lubin. This is Keyes.

1559
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:43,778
Listen. I'm sending
a man named Jackson

1560
01:21:43,803 --> 01:21:45,767
down to you with an
expense account.

1561
01:21:45,851 --> 01:21:47,185
Well, we brought
him down here from.

1562
01:21:47,210 --> 01:21:48,650
Medford, Oregon in
connection with...

1563
01:21:48,729 --> 01:21:50,481
the Dietrichson claim.

1564
01:21:51,565 --> 01:21:53,692
Well, take care of his
hotel bill, will you?

1565
01:21:53,776 --> 01:21:54,860
Ever been in Oregon, Mr. Neff?

1566
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,984
Yeah. He'll be right down.

1567
01:21:56,028 --> 01:21:57,529
No. Never been up there.

1568
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:00,366
Wait a minute.
You go trout fishing?

1569
01:22:00,449 --> 01:22:04,078
Maybe I saw you up Klamath
Falls way. Nope. I don't fish.

1570
01:22:04,412 --> 01:22:07,707
You don't go fishing,
Mr. Neff. Neff. It's the name.

1571
01:22:08,249 --> 01:22:10,835
There's a family of Neffs
in Corvallis. No relation.

1572
01:22:10,918 --> 01:22:13,296
Let me see. This man's an
automobile dealer in Corvallis.

1573
01:22:13,379 --> 01:22:15,739
A very reputable man, too, I'm
told. All right, Mr. Jackson.

1574
01:22:15,798 --> 01:22:17,300
Suppose you go down to
the cashier's office.

1575
01:22:17,383 --> 01:22:18,843
Room 27 on the 11th floor.

1576
01:22:18,927 --> 01:22:20,570
He'll take care of
your expense account

1577
01:22:20,595 --> 01:22:22,222
and your ticket for
the train tonight.

1578
01:22:22,263 --> 01:22:23,264
Tonight?

1579
01:22:23,389 --> 01:22:24,930
Tomorrow morning would
suit me better.

1580
01:22:24,955 --> 01:22:26,601
There's a very good
osteopath in town...

1581
01:22:26,684 --> 01:22:29,479
I'd like to see before
I leave. Osteopath?

1582
01:22:30,021 --> 01:22:33,066
Well, just don't put her
on the expense account.

1583
01:22:33,984 --> 01:22:35,527
Well, goodbye, gentlemen.

1584
01:22:35,610 --> 01:22:37,904
It's been a pleasure. Goodbye.

1585
01:22:40,198 --> 01:22:42,134
There it is, Walter.
It's beginning

1586
01:22:42,159 --> 01:22:44,119
to come apart at
the seams already.

1587
01:22:44,203 --> 01:22:46,955
Murder's never perfect. Always
comes apart sooner or later.

1588
01:22:46,997 --> 01:22:49,458
And when two people are
involved, it's usually sooner.

1589
01:22:49,541 --> 01:22:52,461
Now, we know the Dietrichson dame
is in it, and a somebody else.

1590
01:22:52,503 --> 01:22:54,546
Pretty soon we'll know
who that somebody else is.

1591
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:56,181
He'll show. He's got to show.
Sometime,

1592
01:22:56,206 --> 01:22:57,466
somewhere, they've got to meet.

1593
01:22:57,550 --> 01:22:58,843
Their emotions
are all kicked up.

1594
01:22:58,926 --> 01:23:00,697
Whether it's love or
hate doesn't matter.

1595
01:23:00,722 --> 01:23:02,346
They can't keep away
from each other.

1596
01:23:02,430 --> 01:23:04,950
They may think it's twice as safe
because there are two of them.

1597
01:23:04,974 --> 01:23:06,350
But it isn't twice as safe.

1598
01:23:06,434 --> 01:23:09,604
It's 10 times twice as dangerous.
They've committed a murder...

1599
01:23:09,687 --> 01:23:11,814
and it's not like taking
a trolley ride together...

1600
01:23:11,856 --> 01:23:13,649
where they can get off
at different stops.

1601
01:23:13,691 --> 01:23:15,985
They're stuck with each other
and they've got to ride...

1602
01:23:16,027 --> 01:23:17,487
all the way to
the end of the line.

1603
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:19,906
And it's a one-way trip, and
the last stop is the cemetery.

1604
01:23:19,989 --> 01:23:21,783
She put in her claim.

1605
01:23:22,408 --> 01:23:24,994
I'm gonna throw it
right back at her.

1606
01:23:30,584 --> 01:23:32,335
Let her sue us if she dares.

1607
01:23:32,419 --> 01:23:35,213
I'll be ready for her
and that somebody else.

1608
01:23:35,297 --> 01:23:37,799
They'll be digging
their own graves.

1609
01:23:46,266 --> 01:23:48,936
Mrs. Dietrichson?
This is Jerry's Market.

1610
01:23:49,019 --> 01:23:50,433
We just got in a
shipment of that

1611
01:23:50,458 --> 01:23:51,981
English soap you
were asking about.

1612
01:23:52,064 --> 01:23:55,651
Will you be coming by today?
Thank you, Mrs. Dietrichson.

1613
01:24:22,721 --> 01:24:25,348
Hello, Walter. Come over here.

1614
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:31,980
What's the matter?
Everything's the matter.

1615
01:24:34,024 --> 01:24:35,359
Keyes is rejecting your claim.

1616
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,630
He's sitting back with his mouth

1617
01:24:36,655 --> 01:24:38,028
watering, waiting
for you to sue.

1618
01:24:38,111 --> 01:24:39,905
He wants you to sue,
but you're not going to.

1619
01:24:39,947 --> 01:24:42,866
What's he got to stop me?
He's got plenty.

1620
01:24:45,744 --> 01:24:47,104
He's figured out how
it was worked.

1621
01:24:47,162 --> 01:24:48,956
He knows it was somebody else
on the train...

1622
01:24:49,039 --> 01:24:50,874
and he's dug up a witness
he thinks can prove it.

1623
01:24:50,958 --> 01:24:53,294
Prove it how? If he rejects
that claim, I have to sue.

1624
01:24:53,377 --> 01:24:55,171
Yeah? And then you're
in court and a lot

1625
01:24:55,196 --> 01:24:56,881
of other things are
going to come up.

1626
01:24:56,964 --> 01:25:00,760
Like, for instance, about you
and the first Mrs. Dietrichson.

1627
01:25:00,968 --> 01:25:02,762
What about me and
the first Mrs. Dietrichson?

1628
01:25:02,845 --> 01:25:03,888
The way she died.

1629
01:25:03,971 --> 01:25:05,588
And about that black
hat you were trying

1630
01:25:05,613 --> 01:25:06,974
on before you
needed a black hat.

1631
01:25:07,058 --> 01:25:08,810
Lola's been telling you
some of her cockeyed stories.

1632
01:25:08,893 --> 01:25:10,001
She's been seeing you. I've been

1633
01:25:10,026 --> 01:25:11,306
seeing her, if you want to know.

1634
01:25:11,312 --> 01:25:12,981
So she won't yell her head off
about what she knows.

1635
01:25:13,064 --> 01:25:14,447
She's putting on an
act for you, crying

1636
01:25:14,472 --> 01:25:15,775
all over your shoulder,
the lying...

1637
01:25:15,859 --> 01:25:17,120
Keep her out of this.
All I'm telling

1638
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:18,194
you is we're not going to sue.

1639
01:25:18,278 --> 01:25:19,446
Because you don't want
the money anymore...

1640
01:25:19,529 --> 01:25:20,739
even if you could have it,
because she's...

1641
01:25:20,822 --> 01:25:21,990
made you feel like
a heel all of a sudden?

1642
01:25:22,073 --> 01:25:23,794
It isn't the money anymore.
It's our necks.

1643
01:25:23,819 --> 01:25:25,327
We're pulling out,
do you understand?

1644
01:25:25,410 --> 01:25:28,330
Because of what Keyes can do?
You're not fooling me, Walter.

1645
01:25:28,413 --> 01:25:30,665
It's because of Lola,
what you did to her father.

1646
01:25:30,749 --> 01:25:32,340
You're afraid she might
find out someday

1647
01:25:32,365 --> 01:25:33,627
and you can't take it, can you?

1648
01:25:33,669 --> 01:25:35,629
I said, leave her out of this.

1649
01:25:40,592 --> 01:25:41,844
It's me I'm talking about.

1650
01:25:41,927 --> 01:25:44,096
I don't want to be left
out of it. Stop saying that.

1651
01:25:44,179 --> 01:25:45,556
It's just that it
hasn't worked as we wanted.

1652
01:25:45,639 --> 01:25:47,132
We can't go through
with it, that's all.

1653
01:25:47,157 --> 01:25:48,317
We have gone through with it.

1654
01:25:48,350 --> 01:25:49,435
The tough part is all behind us.

1655
01:25:49,518 --> 01:25:51,979
We just have to hold on now
and not go soft inside...

1656
01:25:52,396 --> 01:25:54,815
stick close together
the way we started out.

1657
01:25:54,857 --> 01:25:56,150
Watch it.

1658
01:26:13,918 --> 01:26:16,504
I loved you, Walter,
and I hated him.

1659
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:20,091
But I wasn't going to do anything
about it, not until I met you.

1660
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:23,803
You planned the whole thing.
I only wanted him dead.

1661
01:26:24,387 --> 01:26:27,015
And I'm the one that
fixed it so he was dead.

1662
01:26:27,098 --> 01:26:30,811
Is that what you're telling
me? And nobody's pulling out.

1663
01:26:30,977 --> 01:26:32,263
We went into this
together, we're

1664
01:26:32,288 --> 01:26:33,528
coming out at the end together.

1665
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:37,359
It's straight down the line
for both of us, remember?

1666
01:26:44,074 --> 01:26:45,701
<i>Yes, I remembered.</i>

1667
01:26:47,077 --> 01:26:50,372
<i>Just like I remembered
what you had told me, Keyes...</i>

1668
01:26:50,414 --> 01:26:52,875
<i>about that trolley car ride...</i>

1669
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:55,378
<i>and how there was no getting
off till the end of the line...</i>

1670
01:26:57,004 --> 01:26:58,881
where the cemetery was.

1671
01:27:00,341 --> 01:27:03,594
And then I got to thinking
what cemeteries are for.

1672
01:27:04,262 --> 01:27:06,514
They're to put dead people in.

1673
01:27:08,266 --> 01:27:09,979
I guess that was
the first time I

1674
01:27:10,004 --> 01:27:11,895
ever thought about
Phyllis that way.

1675
01:27:11,978 --> 01:27:13,521
Dead, I mean.

1676
01:27:14,689 --> 01:27:17,275
And how it would be
if she were dead.

1677
01:27:18,568 --> 01:27:21,404
<i>I saw Lola three or four times
that week.</i>

1678
01:27:22,072 --> 01:27:25,909
<i>One night we went up into the
hills behind the Hollywood Bowl.</i>

1679
01:27:26,118 --> 01:27:28,912
<i>I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes,
but it was only with her that...</i>

1680
01:27:28,995 --> 01:27:31,415
<i>I could relax
and let go a little.</i>

1681
01:28:01,612 --> 01:28:03,322
Why are you crying?

1682
01:28:05,241 --> 01:28:07,452
Not gonna tell me?

1683
01:28:07,619 --> 01:28:11,539
Of course I will, Walter. I
wouldn't tell anybody else but you.

1684
01:28:12,791 --> 01:28:15,668
It's about Nino.
Zachetti? What about him?

1685
01:28:15,835 --> 01:28:18,713
They killed my father
together. He and Phyllis.

1686
01:28:18,797 --> 01:28:21,258
He helped her do it.
I know he did.

1687
01:28:22,092 --> 01:28:24,052
What makes you say that?

1688
01:28:24,469 --> 01:28:26,140
I've been following him.
He's been

1689
01:28:26,165 --> 01:28:27,764
to her house, night after night.

1690
01:28:27,806 --> 01:28:30,225
It was Phyllis
and him all along.

1691
01:28:30,517 --> 01:28:32,866
Maybe he was just going
with me as a blind.

1692
01:28:32,891 --> 01:28:34,563
And the night of the murder...

1693
01:28:34,646 --> 01:28:36,732
You promised me you weren't
gonna talk like this anymore.

1694
01:28:36,815 --> 01:28:40,319
He was supposed to pick me up
after a lecture at UCLA.

1695
01:28:40,402 --> 01:28:43,322
But he never showed up.
He said he was sick.

1696
01:28:44,114 --> 01:28:45,199
Sick!

1697
01:28:47,284 --> 01:28:49,599
He couldn't show up,
because the train

1698
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:51,664
was leaving with
my father on it.

1699
01:28:57,295 --> 01:29:00,590
Maybe I'm just crazy.
Maybe it's all in my mind.

1700
01:29:01,632 --> 01:29:03,634
Sure, it's all in your mind.

1701
01:29:03,718 --> 01:29:07,847
I only wish it were, Walter,
'cause I still love him.

1702
01:29:14,187 --> 01:29:17,607
<i>Zachetti. Phyllis and Zachetti.</i>

1703
01:29:19,317 --> 01:29:21,406
<i>What was he doing
up at her house?</i>

1704
01:29:21,431 --> 01:29:23,363
<i>I couldn't figure that one out.</i>

1705
01:29:25,032 --> 01:29:28,118
<i>I tried to make sense
out of it and got nowhere.</i>

1706
01:29:28,619 --> 01:29:31,622
<i>But the real braintwister
came the next day.</i>

1707
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:34,041
<i>You sprang it on
me, Keyes, after</i>

1708
01:29:34,066 --> 01:29:36,168
<i>office hours, when
you caught me...</i>

1709
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:38,170
<i>down in the lobby
of the building.</i>

1710
01:29:38,212 --> 01:29:40,464
Walter. Walter, just a minute.

1711
01:29:45,094 --> 01:29:48,139
Hello, Keyes. Just hang
on to your hat, Walter.

1712
01:29:48,222 --> 01:29:50,182
What for? Nothing much.

1713
01:29:50,433 --> 01:29:53,311
That Dietrichson case
just busted wide open.

1714
01:29:53,603 --> 01:29:56,606
How do you mean?
The guy showed. That's how.

1715
01:29:57,815 --> 01:30:00,068
What guy?
The guy who helped her do it.

1716
01:30:00,109 --> 01:30:01,819
The somebody else?

1717
01:30:02,737 --> 01:30:05,406
No kidding? Yeah. She
just filed suit against us.

1718
01:30:05,490 --> 01:30:06,783
It's okay by me.

1719
01:30:06,866 --> 01:30:08,283
When we get them
in that courtroom,

1720
01:30:08,308 --> 01:30:09,911
I'll tear them to
pieces, both of them.

1721
01:30:09,994 --> 01:30:12,275
Come on. I'll buy you a martini,
Walter. No thanks, Keyes.

1722
01:30:12,288 --> 01:30:13,289
With two olives.

1723
01:30:13,373 --> 01:30:15,667
No, I've got to get a shave and
a shoeshine. I've got a date.

1724
01:30:15,750 --> 01:30:18,837
Margie. I still bet she drinks
from the bottle.

1725
01:30:19,463 --> 01:30:21,173
They give you matches
when you buy cigars, you know.

1726
01:30:21,256 --> 01:30:22,616
All you have to do is
ask for them.

1727
01:30:22,632 --> 01:30:24,854
Don't like them,
they always explode

1728
01:30:24,879 --> 01:30:26,762
in my pocket. So long, Walter.

1729
01:30:31,099 --> 01:30:33,102
<i>I was scared stiff, Keyes.</i>

1730
01:30:33,435 --> 01:30:36,271
<i>Maybe you were playing
cat-and-mouse with me.</i>

1731
01:30:36,313 --> 01:30:39,483
<i>Maybe you knew all along
I was the somebody else.</i>

1732
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:44,113
<i>I had to find out, and I knew
where to look. In your office.</i>

1733
01:31:16,688 --> 01:31:18,148
<i>Memo to Mr. Norton.</i>

1734
01:31:18,231 --> 01:31:19,900
<i>Confidential. Dietrichson file.</i>

1735
01:31:20,692 --> 01:31:22,104
<i>With regard to your
proposal to put.</i>

1736
01:31:22,129 --> 01:31:23,487
<i>Walter Neff under
surveillance...</i>

1737
01:31:23,528 --> 01:31:25,238
<i>I disagree absolutely.</i>

1738
01:31:25,322 --> 01:31:27,658
<i>I have investigated his movements
on the night of the crime...</i>

1739
01:31:27,741 --> 01:31:31,578
<i>and he's definitely placed in
his apartment from 7:15 p. M. On.</i>

1740
01:31:32,162 --> 01:31:33,920
<i>In addition to
this, I have known.</i>

1741
01:31:33,945 --> 01:31:35,624
<i>Neff intimately for 11 years...</i>

1742
01:31:35,708 --> 01:31:39,003
<i>and I personally vouch for him
without reservation.</i>

1743
01:31:44,717 --> 01:31:47,637
<i>Furthermore, no connection
whatsoever has been established...</i>

1744
01:31:47,720 --> 01:31:50,056
<i>between Walter Neff and
Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson...</i>

1745
01:31:50,139 --> 01:31:52,132
<i>whereas I am now able
to report that such</i>

1746
01:31:52,157 --> 01:31:53,935
<i>a connection has
been established...</i>

1747
01:31:54,018 --> 01:31:56,145
<i>between her and another man.</i>

1748
01:31:56,312 --> 01:31:59,190
<i>This man has been observed
to visit Mrs. Dietrichson...</i>

1749
01:31:59,232 --> 01:32:02,610
<i>on the nights of July 9th,
10th, 11th, 12th and 13th.</i>

1750
01:32:03,361 --> 01:32:07,073
<i>We have succeeded in identifying
him as one Nino Zachetti...</i>

1751
01:32:07,198 --> 01:32:09,659
<i>former medical student,
age of 28...</i>

1752
01:32:09,743 --> 01:32:12,037
<i>residing at
Lilac Court Apartments...</i>

1753
01:32:12,078 --> 01:32:14,998
<i>12281/2 North La Brea Avenue.</i>

1754
01:32:15,540 --> 01:32:17,456
<i>We have checked
Zachetti's movements</i>

1755
01:32:17,481 --> 01:32:19,002
<i>on the night of the crime...</i>

1756
01:32:19,044 --> 01:32:21,880
<i>and have found that
they cannot be accounted for.</i>

1757
01:32:22,297 --> 01:32:25,551
<i>I am preparing a more detailed
report for your consideration.</i>

1758
01:32:25,592 --> 01:32:27,351
<i>It is my belief that
we already have</i>

1759
01:32:27,376 --> 01:32:29,304
<i>sufficient evidence
against Zachetti...</i>

1760
01:32:29,388 --> 01:32:32,433
<i>and Mrs. Dietrichson
to justify police action.</i>

1761
01:32:32,725 --> 01:32:34,326
<i>I strongly urge that
this whole matter</i>

1762
01:32:34,351 --> 01:32:35,686
<i>be turned over to the office...</i>

1763
01:32:35,769 --> 01:32:37,730
<i>of the district attorney.</i>

1764
01:32:37,771 --> 01:32:39,857
<i>Respectfully, Barton Keyes.</i>

1765
01:33:16,061 --> 01:33:19,773
Phyllis? It's Walter.
I've got to see you. Tonight.

1766
01:33:21,233 --> 01:33:23,235
Yes, it has to be tonight.

1767
01:33:23,861 --> 01:33:25,279
How's 11:00?

1768
01:33:26,447 --> 01:33:28,240
Don't worry about Keyes.

1769
01:33:28,282 --> 01:33:31,285
Just leave the front door
unlocked and put the lights out.

1770
01:33:31,327 --> 01:33:34,288
No, nobody's watching
the house. Not anymore.

1771
01:33:34,830 --> 01:33:36,625
It's just for the neighbors. I

1772
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:38,834
told you not to
worry about Keyes.

1773
01:33:39,919 --> 01:33:42,797
I'll see you at 11:00. Yeah.

1774
01:33:44,632 --> 01:33:46,092
Goodbye, baby.

1775
01:33:50,054 --> 01:33:51,806
<i>I guess I
don't have to tell you...</i>

1776
01:33:51,848 --> 01:33:54,517
<i>what I intended to do
at 11:00, Keyes.</i>

1777
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:56,419
<i>For the first time,
I saw a way to get</i>

1778
01:33:56,444 --> 01:33:58,146
<i>clear of the whole
mess I was in...</i>

1779
01:33:58,229 --> 01:34:01,065
<i>and of Phyllis, too,
all at the same time.</i>

1780
01:34:01,399 --> 01:34:03,526
<i>Yeah, that's what I thought.</i>

1781
01:34:04,152 --> 01:34:07,530
<i>What I didn't know was that
she had plans of her own.</i>

1782
01:35:07,050 --> 01:35:08,635
In here, Walter.

1783
01:35:23,484 --> 01:35:24,902
Hello, baby.

1784
01:35:27,112 --> 01:35:29,823
Anybody else in the house?
Nobody. Why?

1785
01:35:31,367 --> 01:35:34,245
What's that music?
A radio up the street.

1786
01:35:42,753 --> 01:35:45,715
Just like the first time
I came here, isn't it?

1787
01:35:45,756 --> 01:35:48,593
We were talking about
automobile insurance.

1788
01:35:48,968 --> 01:35:51,512
Only you were thinking
about murder.

1789
01:35:52,597 --> 01:35:54,474
I was thinking about
that anklet.

1790
01:35:54,557 --> 01:35:56,434
And what are you
thinking about now?

1791
01:35:56,476 --> 01:35:58,770
I'm all through thinking, baby.

1792
01:35:58,978 --> 01:36:01,272
I just came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?

1793
01:36:01,481 --> 01:36:05,485
Where are you going? You're the
one that's going, baby. Not me.

1794
01:36:05,777 --> 01:36:08,363
I'm getting off the trolley
car right at this corner.

1795
01:36:08,447 --> 01:36:10,907
Suppose you stop being fancy.
Let's have it, whatever it is.

1796
01:36:10,991 --> 01:36:14,453
All right, I'll tell you. A friend
of mine's got a funny theory.

1797
01:36:14,828 --> 01:36:16,388
He says when two people
commit a murder,

1798
01:36:16,405 --> 01:36:17,789
it's sort of like
they're riding...

1799
01:36:17,873 --> 01:36:20,501
on a trolley car together. One
can't get off without the other.

1800
01:36:20,584 --> 01:36:22,878
They're stuck with each other
and they have to go on...

1801
01:36:22,961 --> 01:36:25,255
riding together
clear to the end of the line.

1802
01:36:25,297 --> 01:36:27,633
And the last stop
is the cemetery.

1803
01:36:27,675 --> 01:36:30,845
Maybe he's got something
there. You bet he has.

1804
01:36:30,970 --> 01:36:33,681
Two people are gonna ride to
the end of the line, all right.

1805
01:36:33,764 --> 01:36:35,896
Only I'm not gonna be one of them.
I've

1806
01:36:35,921 --> 01:36:38,185
got another guy to
finish my ride for me.

1807
01:36:38,269 --> 01:36:41,731
Just who are you talking
about? An acquaintance of yours.

1808
01:36:41,814 --> 01:36:43,149
A Mr. Zachetti.

1809
01:36:43,191 --> 01:36:44,984
Come on, baby,
I just got into this thing...

1810
01:36:45,068 --> 01:36:46,301
because I happen
to know a little

1811
01:36:46,326 --> 01:36:47,726
something about
insurance, didn't I?

1812
01:36:47,779 --> 01:36:48,780
I was a sucker.

1813
01:36:48,863 --> 01:36:50,291
I'd have been brushed
off just as soon

1814
01:36:50,316 --> 01:36:51,676
as you got your
hands on the money.

1815
01:36:51,699 --> 01:36:54,369
Nobody wanted to brush you
off. Save it. I'm telling this.

1816
01:36:54,828 --> 01:36:56,871
It's been you and that Zachetti
guy all along, hasn't it?

1817
01:36:56,955 --> 01:36:58,540
That's not true.

1818
01:36:58,623 --> 01:37:01,751
Doesn't make any difference
if it's true or not.

1819
01:37:03,003 --> 01:37:04,827
The point is, Keyes
believes Zachetti

1820
01:37:04,852 --> 01:37:06,506
is the one he's
been looking for.

1821
01:37:06,590 --> 01:37:07,986
He'll have him in
that gas chamber

1822
01:37:08,011 --> 01:37:09,634
before he knows what's
happened to him.

1823
01:37:09,718 --> 01:37:13,096
What's happening to me all
this time? Don't be silly, baby.

1824
01:37:18,352 --> 01:37:20,413
What do you think is
gonna happen to you?

1825
01:37:20,438 --> 01:37:22,523
You helped him do the
murder, didn't you?

1826
01:37:22,606 --> 01:37:23,899
That's what Keyes thinks.

1827
01:37:23,983 --> 01:37:26,235
And what's good enough for
Keyes is good enough for me.

1828
01:37:26,318 --> 01:37:28,814
Maybe it's not good
enough for me, Walter.

1829
01:37:28,839 --> 01:37:30,656
Maybe I don't go for the idea.

1830
01:37:30,698 --> 01:37:32,575
Maybe I'd rather talk.

1831
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:35,317
Sometimes people are
where they can't talk.

1832
01:37:35,342 --> 01:37:37,204
Under six feet of dirt, maybe.

1833
01:37:37,538 --> 01:37:39,591
And if it was you,
they'd charge that

1834
01:37:39,616 --> 01:37:41,584
up to Zachetti,
too, wouldn't they?

1835
01:37:41,667 --> 01:37:45,380
Sure they would, and that's
just what's gonna happen, baby.

1836
01:37:45,797 --> 01:37:48,299
'Cause he's coming here
tonight, in about 15 minutes.

1837
01:37:48,383 --> 01:37:51,845
With the cops right behind
him. It's all taken care of.

1838
01:37:52,929 --> 01:37:55,223
That would make everything
lovely for you, wouldn't it?

1839
01:37:55,265 --> 01:37:57,226
Right. And it's got
to be done before

1840
01:37:57,251 --> 01:37:59,185
that suit of yours
comes to trial...

1841
01:37:59,227 --> 01:38:00,729
and Lola gets a chance
to sound off...

1842
01:38:00,937 --> 01:38:02,456
before they trip you
up on the stand, and

1843
01:38:02,481 --> 01:38:04,024
you start to go in
drag me down with you.

1844
01:38:04,065 --> 01:38:05,175
Maybe I had Zachetti
here so they

1845
01:38:05,200 --> 01:38:06,401
won't get a chance
to trip me up...

1846
01:38:06,485 --> 01:38:08,045
so we can get the money
and be together.

1847
01:38:08,320 --> 01:38:09,882
That's cute. Say it again.
He came

1848
01:38:09,907 --> 01:38:11,448
here first to ask
where Lola was.

1849
01:38:11,531 --> 01:38:13,575
I made him come back.
I was working on him.

1850
01:38:13,659 --> 01:38:15,661
He's a crazy sort of guy,
quick-tempered.

1851
01:38:15,744 --> 01:38:17,913
I kept hammering into him that
she was with another man...

1852
01:38:17,996 --> 01:38:20,322
so he'd go into one
of his jealous rages,

1853
01:38:20,347 --> 01:38:22,418
and then I'd tell
him where she was.

1854
01:38:22,459 --> 01:38:25,170
And you know what he would've
done to her, don't you, Walter?

1855
01:38:25,254 --> 01:38:27,282
Yeah, and for once
I believe you,

1856
01:38:27,307 --> 01:38:29,300
because it's just rotten enough.

1857
01:38:30,176 --> 01:38:31,844
We're both rotten.

1858
01:38:31,927 --> 01:38:33,596
Only you're
a little more rotten.

1859
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:35,765
You got me to take care
of your husband for you...

1860
01:38:35,848 --> 01:38:37,642
and then you got
Zachetti to take care

1861
01:38:37,667 --> 01:38:39,393
of Lola, maybe take
care of me, too.

1862
01:38:39,435 --> 01:38:41,098
Then somebody else
would have come along

1863
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:42,522
to take care of
Zachetti for you.

1864
01:38:42,605 --> 01:38:45,274
That's the way you operate,
isn't it, baby? Suppose it is.

1865
01:38:45,358 --> 01:38:48,653
Is what you've got cooked up
for tonight any better?

1866
01:38:49,487 --> 01:38:53,199
I don't like that music anymore.
Mind if I close the window?

1867
01:39:13,470 --> 01:39:16,432
You can do better than that,
can't you, baby?

1868
01:39:16,640 --> 01:39:18,434
Better try it again.

1869
01:39:21,186 --> 01:39:23,522
Maybe if I came a little closer?

1870
01:39:34,033 --> 01:39:36,536
How's this?
Think you can do it now?

1871
01:39:45,545 --> 01:39:47,964
Why didn't you
shoot again, baby?

1872
01:39:53,678 --> 01:39:55,578
Don't tell me it's
because you've

1873
01:39:55,603 --> 01:39:57,641
been in love with
me all this time.

1874
01:39:57,682 --> 01:40:01,144
No, I never loved you, Walter,
not you or anybody else.

1875
01:40:01,394 --> 01:40:04,648
I'm rotten to the heart.
I used you, just as you said.

1876
01:40:04,690 --> 01:40:07,150
That's all you
ever meant to me...

1877
01:40:08,318 --> 01:40:10,028
until a minute ago...

1878
01:40:11,196 --> 01:40:13,824
when I couldn't fire
that second shot.

1879
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:18,162
I never thought
that could happen to me.

1880
01:40:19,163 --> 01:40:21,707
Sorry, baby. I'm not buying.
I'm not asking you to buy.

1881
01:40:21,790 --> 01:40:23,542
Just hold me close.

1882
01:40:29,966 --> 01:40:31,467
Goodbye, baby.

1883
01:41:26,107 --> 01:41:27,358
Zachetti.

1884
01:41:29,527 --> 01:41:30,862
Come here.

1885
01:41:36,743 --> 01:41:38,411
I said, come here.

1886
01:41:41,122 --> 01:41:44,167
My name is Neff. Yeah,
and I still don't like it.

1887
01:41:44,250 --> 01:41:45,877
What do you want?

1888
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:47,253
Look, kid.

1889
01:41:48,421 --> 01:41:51,675
I want to give you a present.
This nice new nickel.

1890
01:41:51,841 --> 01:41:53,927
What's the gag? Suppose you
go on back down the hill...

1891
01:41:53,969 --> 01:41:55,595
to the drugstore
and make a phone call.

1892
01:41:55,637 --> 01:41:57,764
Keep your nickel and buy
yourself an ice-cream cone.

1893
01:41:57,806 --> 01:41:59,599
The number is Granite-0-3-8-6.

1894
01:41:59,641 --> 01:42:02,227
Ask for Miss Dietrichson.
First name is Lola.

1895
01:42:02,311 --> 01:42:03,395
She isn't worth a nickel.

1896
01:42:03,478 --> 01:42:05,958
If I ever talk to her, it's not
going to be over any telephone.

1897
01:42:06,023 --> 01:42:07,065
Tough, aren't you?

1898
01:42:07,149 --> 01:42:09,229
Here, take the nickel and
call her. She wants you to.

1899
01:42:09,234 --> 01:42:10,986
She doesn't want any part of me.

1900
01:42:11,278 --> 01:42:13,822
I know who told you that.
It's not true.

1901
01:42:13,906 --> 01:42:16,450
Lola's in love with you.
She always has been.

1902
01:42:16,492 --> 01:42:18,744
Don't ask me why.
I couldn't even guess.

1903
01:42:18,828 --> 01:42:22,081
Here. Granite-0-3-8-6.
Now go on and call her.

1904
01:42:22,748 --> 01:42:24,333
Go on. That way.

1905
01:42:34,594 --> 01:42:36,763
It's almost 4:30 now, Keyes.

1906
01:42:38,139 --> 01:42:39,182
It's cold.

1907
01:42:41,267 --> 01:42:44,854
I wonder if she's still lying
alone up there in that house...

1908
01:42:44,938 --> 01:42:47,065
or if they've found her by now.

1909
01:42:48,733 --> 01:42:52,028
I wonder a lot of things.
They don't matter anymore.

1910
01:42:56,324 --> 01:42:59,328
Except I want you to do
a favor for me, Keyes.

1911
01:43:00,203 --> 01:43:02,787
I want you to be the
one to tell Lola, kind

1912
01:43:02,812 --> 01:43:05,125
of gently, before it
breaks wide open.

1913
01:43:06,794 --> 01:43:10,506
And I want you to take care
of her and that guy Zachetti...

1914
01:43:15,094 --> 01:43:17,888
so he doesn't get
pushed around too much.

1915
01:43:19,890 --> 01:43:21,350
Hello, Keyes.

1916
01:43:31,277 --> 01:43:33,404
Up pretty early, aren't you?

1917
01:43:34,864 --> 01:43:38,201
I always wondered what time
you got down to the office.

1918
01:43:38,910 --> 01:43:42,080
Or did that little man of
yours pull you out of bed?

1919
01:43:42,163 --> 01:43:43,748
The janitor did.

1920
01:43:44,582 --> 01:43:47,210
Seems you leaked a little
blood on the way in here.

1921
01:43:47,294 --> 01:43:48,378
Yeah.

1922
01:43:48,878 --> 01:43:50,755
Wouldn't be surprised.

1923
01:43:52,174 --> 01:43:55,719
I wanted to straighten you out
on that Dietrichson case.

1924
01:43:56,094 --> 01:43:57,512
So I gather.

1925
01:43:59,181 --> 01:44:02,559
How long have you been
standing there? Long enough.

1926
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:05,604
Kind of a crazy story
with a crazy twist to it.

1927
01:44:06,522 --> 01:44:08,524
One you didn't quite figure out.

1928
01:44:08,607 --> 01:44:11,026
You can't figure them all,
Walter.

1929
01:44:11,652 --> 01:44:14,405
That's right.
I guess you can't at that.

1930
01:44:15,656 --> 01:44:18,242
Now I suppose
I get the big speech...

1931
01:44:19,285 --> 01:44:22,246
the one with all the
two-dollar words in it.

1932
01:44:23,456 --> 01:44:25,249
Let's have it, Keyes.

1933
01:44:26,626 --> 01:44:29,796
Walter, you're all washed up.

1934
01:44:32,423 --> 01:44:34,926
Thanks, Keyes.
That was short anyway.

1935
01:44:36,302 --> 01:44:38,429
I'm gonna call for a doctor.

1936
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:43,268
What for?
So they can patch me up?

1937
01:44:44,311 --> 01:44:46,980
So they can nurse me along
till I get back on my feet?

1938
01:44:47,063 --> 01:44:48,773
So I can walk into
that gas chamber

1939
01:44:48,798 --> 01:44:50,484
up at San Quentin
on my own power?

1940
01:44:50,525 --> 01:44:52,110
Is that it, Keyes?

1941
01:44:52,194 --> 01:44:53,862
Something like that.

1942
01:44:54,821 --> 01:44:57,157
I've got a different idea. Yeah?

1943
01:44:57,199 --> 01:44:58,575
Look, Keyes.

1944
01:44:58,951 --> 01:45:01,328
Suppose you went back to bed and
didn't find these cylinders...

1945
01:45:01,411 --> 01:45:03,789
till tomorrow morning,
when the office opens...

1946
01:45:03,831 --> 01:45:06,458
After that you can
play it any way you like.

1947
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:09,128
Would you do
that much for me, Keyes?

1948
01:45:09,378 --> 01:45:11,186
Give me one good reason. I need

1949
01:45:11,211 --> 01:45:13,340
four hours to get
where I'm going.

1950
01:45:13,382 --> 01:45:16,594
You're not going anywhere,
Walter. You bet I am.

1951
01:45:17,511 --> 01:45:20,389
I'm going across the border.
You haven't got a chance, Walter.

1952
01:45:20,473 --> 01:45:22,016
Good enough to try for.

1953
01:45:22,099 --> 01:45:25,520
You'll never make the border.
That's what you think.

1954
01:45:26,229 --> 01:45:27,730
Just watch me.

1955
01:45:28,189 --> 01:45:30,316
You'll never even make
the elevator.

1956
01:45:30,566 --> 01:45:31,567
So long, Keyes.

1957
01:46:01,223 --> 01:46:02,516
Hello...

1958
01:46:02,558 --> 01:46:05,185
send an ambulance to the
Pacific Building on Olive Street.

1959
01:46:07,396 --> 01:46:09,398
Yeah. It's a police job.

1960
01:46:29,210 --> 01:46:31,754
How you doing, Walter? Fine.

1961
01:46:34,007 --> 01:46:37,552
Only somebody moved the
elevator a couple of miles away.

1962
01:46:38,094 --> 01:46:39,846
They're on the way.

1963
01:46:44,184 --> 01:46:46,812
You know why you couldn't
figure this one, Keyes?

1964
01:46:46,895 --> 01:46:48,396
I'll tell you.

1965
01:46:48,939 --> 01:46:52,192
Because the guy you were
looking for was too close.

1966
01:46:52,275 --> 01:46:54,903
He was right across
the desk from you.

1967
01:46:55,112 --> 01:46:57,072
